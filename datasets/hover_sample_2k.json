    "claim": "Pressing the 'CANCEL' button twice at an ATM will prevent thieves from stealing your PIN.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "If you\u2019re looking for security tips or best practices for preventing your information (and money) from being stolen at an ATM, you can turn to organizations such as the American Bankers Association, law enforcement agencies, or the bank that issued your card. On the other hand, you\u2019re probably better off avoiding advice from unsourced social media posts.  In November 2018, many Facebook and Twitter users encountered a message claiming that pressing the CANCEL button twice before swiping their cards at ATM machines would prevent their PINs from being stolen:  This message did not originate with law enforcement, a financial institution, a cybersecurity firm, or any other authoritative source (although some versions referenced a vague \u201cbanker friend\u201c). Nor did this bit of advice specify what form of ATM fraud it would putatively deter. Although it\u2019s possible that some particular ATM theft scheme exists which might be thwarted by a user\u2019s pressing the machine\u2019s CLEAR button twice ahead of a transaction, this advice will not work as a general safety mechanism. The most common methods for capturing account information and PINs via compromised ATMs are: 1) The installation of a false front on an ATM. 2) The installation of a card \u201cskimmer\u201d (i.e., a device attached to a card reader slot which copies information). 3) The installation of a \u201cLebanese loop\u201d (i.e., a small plastic device with a barb that holds a card back in the machine). 4) The installation of an overlay on top of the numeric ATM pad to capture PINs. 5) The installation of hidden cameras to record user keystrokes (including the entry of PINs). None of these schemes is likely to be thwarted by pressing the CLEAR button before a transaction, as none of them relies upon \u201cfront-loading\u201d the encrypted PIN pad with input.  We perused the security advice offered by a variety of institutions and found no organization recommending the \u201cdouble cancel\u201d input method. Instead, the most common PIN safety tips are the following: When we reached out to the American Bankers Association to verify whether they had heard of this advice, or if they themselves had ever recommended ATM customers to press \u201ccancel twice\u201d in order to prevent their PINs from being stolen, they told us that \u201cthis was not something that we have heard of\u201d and offered some additional ATM safety recommendations: David Tente, the executive director of the ATM Industry Association, told us that this claim was \u201ccompletely false\u201d: Hitting the \u201ccancel\u201d button twice before using an ATM may not have any downside, but users shouldn\u2019t expect this procedure to do much of anything to keep their information safe from thieves and scammers.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 e6km2 , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area . Canada 's border with the United States is the world 's longest binational land border . The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate , but southerly areas are warm in summer . Canada is sparsely populated , the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains . It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , many near the southern border . One third of the population lives in the three largest cities : Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver . Its capital is Ottawa , and other major urban areas include Calgary , Edmonton , Quebec City , Winnipeg and Hamilton .   Various aboriginal peoples had inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French claims were made on the area , with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1535 during Jacques Cartier 's second voyage to New France . As a consequence of various conflicts , Great Britain gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left , in the late 18th century , with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today . Pursuant to the British North America Act , on July 1 , 1867 , the colonies of Canada , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada . This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada .   In 1931 , Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931 , but at the time , Canada decided to allow the British Parliament to temporarily retain the power to amend Canada 's constitution , on request from the Parliament of Canada . With the Constitution Act 1982 , Canada took over that authority -LRB- as the conclusion of Patriation -RRB- , removing the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom , giving the country full sovereignty .   Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy , with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state . The country is officially bilingual at the federal level . It is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries . Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Canada 's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture .   Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index . It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education . Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations , a member of the Francophonie , and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the G8 , the Group of Ten , the G20 , the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .

The film was directed by John Huston and produced by Sam Spiegel and John Woolf . The screenplay was adapted by James Agee , John Huston , John Collier and Peter Viertel . It was photographed in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff and had a music score by Allan Gray . The film stars Humphrey Bogart -LRB- who won the Academy Award for Best Actor -- his only Oscar -RRB- , and Katharine Hepburn with Robert Morley , Peter Bull , Walter Gotell , Richard Marner and Theodore Bikel .   The African Queen was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1994 , with the Library of Congress deeming it `` culturally , historically or aesthetically significant '' . The film currently holds a 100 % `` Fresh '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 37 reviews . , Morning Glory is a 1933 Pre-Code American drama film which tells the story of an eager would-be actress and her journey to stardom , and what she loses as a result . The picture stars Katharine Hepburn , Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , and Adolphe Menjou , was adapted by Howard J. Green from a then not yet stage produced play with the same name by Zo\u00eb Akins , and was directed by Lowell Sherman . Hepburn won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for this movie . Morning Glory was remade in 1958 under the title Stage Struck . , Katharine Houghton Hepburn -LRB- May 12 , 1907 -- June 29 , 2003 -RRB- was an American actress . Known for her fierce independence and spirited personality , Hepburn was a leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years . She appeared in a range of genres , from screwball comedy to literary drama , and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress -- a record for any performer . In 1999 , Hepburn was named by the American Film Institute as the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema .   Raised in Connecticut by wealthy , progressive parents , Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College . After four years in the theatre , favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood . Her early years in the film industry were marked with success , including an Academy Award for her third picture , Morning Glory -LRB- 1933 -RRB- , but this was followed by a series of commercial failures that led her to be labeled `` box office poison '' in 1938 . Hepburn masterminded her own comeback , buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story , which she sold on the condition that she be the star . In the 1940s , she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy . The screen-partnership spanned 25 years and produced nine movies .   Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life , as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles . She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters , such as in The African Queen -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , a persona the public embraced . Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner -LRB- 1967 -RRB- , The Lion in Winter -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , and On Golden Pond -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . In the 1970s , she began appearing in television films , which became the focus of her career in later life . She remained active into old age , making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87 . After a period of inactivity and ill health , Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96 .   Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine and refused to conform to society 's expectations of women . She was outspoken , assertive , athletic , and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so . She married once , as a young woman , but thereafter lived independently . A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public . With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen , Hepburn epitomized the `` modern woman '' in the 20th-century United States and is remembered as an important cultural figure .

In the wake of the coronavirus scare, many states have decided to keep schools and educational institutes shut till March 31. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 to impose a complete ban on social, religious and political gatherings of more than 50 people in the national capital.  Weddings are permitted, for now, said Kejriwal.  But he appealed to people to put off the weddings also if they can. \u201cWe have already shut schools, colleges, swimming pools so far.  Today, it has been decided to order gyms, night clubs and spas also to close as a precautionary measure,\u201d Kejriwal told a news conference after a review of the steps taken by the city government to prevent community transmission of the infection.

    "evidence": "The Centre has raised concern about the potential surge of Covid-19 cases during the upcoming Mahakumbh and directed the Uttarakhand government to put in place stringent measures to control the spread of the viral illness at the religious congregation scheduled to begin in Haridwar on April 1. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to state chief secretary Om Prakash \u201cstrongly highlighting the concerns raised by the high level central team in its visit to Uttarakhand and about the need of stringent measures to control the spread of Covid19 during Kumbh Mela\u201d, the Union health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The development comes a day after Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat assured devotees that all \u201cunnecessary\u201d restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19 will be removed for the event, and asserted that \u201cfaith is stronger than fear\u201d.  The CM\u2019s statement also comes a time several states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, have introduced restrictions on gatherings and other curbs to stem the viral outbreak. The director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr SK Singh, led the high level central team that visited Uttarakhand on March 16-17, 2021, to review the medical and public health preparedness measures undertaken by the state for the event. Bhushan, in his letter, pointed out that at least 12 states in the country have reported a spike in the daily number of Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks, and that pilgrims who are likely to visit Haridwar for the congregation could also be from among the affected states.  There is a \u201cpotential of an upsurge in cases in the local population after the auspicious Shahi Snan days during the Kumbh Mela\u201d, the statement read, referring to the Hindu ritual of taking a holy bath in river Ganga. States such as Maharashta, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh accounted for 77. 7% of the new cases on Saturday. The health secretary also said the daily Covid-19 testing of 55,000 people in Haridwar was not enough given the large numbers of pilgrims expected, and that cases were already rising.  \u201cThis positivity rate has the potential to rapidly turn into an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh,\u201d Bhushan said. Despite a raging pandemic, at least 30 million people are expected to attend the curtailed Mahakumbh (one-month-long), believed to be the largest religious congregation held every 12 years.  Normally, 120 million pilgrims attend the congregation that is usually a four-month-long event. Among other measures that the Centre has advised Uttarakhand are to ensure that Union health ministry\u2019s standard operating procedures issued for the Kumbh are strictly followed, scale up testing in potential high transmission areas, and continue periodic testing of frontline workers before and after the shahi snan days. The advisory further states that in case of a sudden surge or a super-spreader event (when one infected individual goes on to infect several others), the state administration should promptly send samples for genome sequencing.  This could help monitor if the outbreak is due to a variant that may be more infective than the predominant type of Sars-CoV-2. Much like the trend in the rest of the country, Uttarakhand has been seeing a resurgence of cases in the past month, in what the experts say could be the beginning of second wave of infections.  In the past week, the state reported 80 cases a day on average \u2013 a rise of 174% from the 29 cases a day (seven-day average) it was reporting in the week ending February 25. ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death came in just a week after the death of his ex-manager Disha Salian.  Since then, conspiracy theories interlinking the two deaths have been floating on the internet.  Though the police declared both the deaths as suicide, several people are still speculating that both Sushant and Disha might have been murdered.  Several Bollywood celebrities like Salman Khan, Karan Johar and Sooraj Pancholi are being slammed on social media after the death of Sushant and Disha for their possible link with the two deaths. Amid this, a party picture is going viral on social media in which actor Sooraj Pancholi is present along with some other people.  In this picture, a girl holding a glass and standing next to Sooraj is being referred to as Disha Salian. While Sooraj denied knowing and meeting Disha Salian ever, he is now being trolled on account of this photograph. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false.  The girl in the picture who's being called Disha Salian is Sooraj Pancholi's friend Anushri Gaur. On August 5, a parody account of actress Kangana Ranaut posted the viral picture with the caption, \"Pancholi said he doesn't know Disha.  He Never Met Her in His Entire Life. \"The archived version of this post can be seen here. Several social media users have shared this picture with similar claims.  Some such Twitter posts can be seen here, here and here.  On Facebook as well, this picture is being shared with a similar claim. By the time of filing this story, the Twitter post of Kangana Ranaut's parody account had been shared by around 1,000 people. A user has commented, \"Disha should have maintained distance from Pancholi as he is the murderer of Jiah Khan. \"\"The closeness proves both are love birds! \" says another. On August 5, actor Sooraj Pancholi had refuted this claim by writing an angry Instagram post. Complete bullshit! !  #FuckYouFakeMEDIA Is this the media we are supposed to trust? ?  That girl in the picture which was clicked in 2016 is not \u201cDisha Salian\u201d that is my friend @agaur21 (Anushri Gaur) who doesn\u2019t even live in India . .  Please stop brainwashing people and PLEASE stop harassing me and dragging me into this !  Start being responsible of your actions as it can ruin someone\u2019s life !  I have said this before and I\u2019m saying it again \u201cI have never met or spoken to Disha Salian in my life\u201d Seriously FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOUR FAKE NEWS!  I\u2019ve had enough. A post shared by  Sooraj Pancholi (@soorajpancholi) on Aug 5, 2020 at 10:09am PDTHe had also mentioned that the girl in the picture who's being addressed as Disha Salian is his friend Anushri Gaur who doesn't even live in India.  Sooraj had also tagged Anushri Gaur in his post. We compared the viral picture with the pictures of Anushri Gaur posted on her Instagram account.  The similarities between the two pictures is uncanny. The features of Disha Salian, on the other hand, do not match with the features of the girl in the viral picture. We contacted Anushri through her Instagram account who confirmed that in the viral image, the girl holding the glass, standing close to Sooraj Pancholi is, in fact, her. Hence, we can say that the claim being made on social media is false.  The girl in the viral picture who's being called Disha Salian is actor Sooraj Pancholi's friend Anushri Gaur. The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie. ",

Called the `` King of Pop '' , his contributions to music , dance , and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades .   The eighth child of the Jackson family , Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 . He began his solo career in 1971 . In the early 1980s , Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music . His music videos , including those of `` Beat It '' , `` Billie Jean '' , and `` Thriller '' from his 1982 album Thriller , are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool . The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame . Jackson 's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles `` I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You '' , `` Bad '' , `` The Way You Make Me Feel '' , `` Man in the Mirror '' , and `` Dirty Diana '' , becoming the first album to have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 . He continued to innovate with videos such as `` Black or White '' and `` Scream '' throughout the 1990s , and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist . Through stage and video performances , Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques , such as the robot and the moonwalk , to which he gave the name . His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres .   Thriller is the best-selling album of all time , with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide . Jackson 's other albums , including Off the Wall -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , Bad -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , Dangerous -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , and HIStory -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , also rank among the world 's best-selling albums . He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records . Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice , and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the only dancer from pop and rock music . His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records , 13 Grammy Awards , the Grammy Legend Award , the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , 26 American Music Awards -- more than any other artist -- including the `` Artist of the Century '' and `` Artist of the 1980s '' , 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career -- more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era -- and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide . Jackson won hundreds of awards , making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music . He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when `` Love Never Felt So Good '' reached number nine on May 21 , 2014 . Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism , and , in 2000 , the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities , more than any other entertainer .   Aspects of Jackson 's personal life , including his changing appearance , personal relationships , and behavior , generated controversy . In 1993 , he was accused of child sexual abuse , but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought . In 2005 , he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts . While preparing for his comeback concert series , This Is It , Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25 , 2009 , after suffering from cardiac arrest . The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide , and his personal physician , Conrad Murray , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter . Jackson 's death triggered a global outpouring of grief , and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world . Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity , with earnings of $ 825 million in 2016 , the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication . , Benzodiazepines -LRB- BZD , BZs -RRB- , sometimes called `` benzos '' , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . The first such drug , chlordiazepoxide -LRB- Librium -RRB- , was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann -- La Roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam -LRB- Valium -RRB- . In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications .   Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid -LRB- GABA -RRB- at the GABAA receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic -LRB- sleep-inducing -RRB- , anxiolytic -LRB- anti-anxiety -RRB- , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short - , intermediate - , or long-acting . Short - and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety .   Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . Long-term use is controversial because of concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects , decreasing effectiveness , and physical dependence and withdrawal . As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines , withdrawal from benzodiazepines , in general , leads to improved physical and mental health . The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short - and long-term adverse effects , and as a result , all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults .   There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy . While they are not major teratogens , uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure ; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn . Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness . However , they are less toxic than their predecessors , the barbiturates , and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken . When combined with other central nervous system -LRB- CNS -RRB- depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids , the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases . Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse . ",

It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , constipation , depression , and weight gain . Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre . Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby , which is called cretinism .   Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . In countries with enough iodine in the diet , the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Less common causes include : previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone -LRB- TSH -RRB- and thyroxine levels .   Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization . Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine . The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy . While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important , excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism .   Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient ; however , it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism . In the United States , hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3 -- 0.4 % of people . Subclinical hypothyroidism , a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level , is thought to occur in 4.3 -- 8.5 % of people in the United States . Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men . People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected . Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism and in rare cases cats and horses can also have the disorder .

    "evidence": "The Restoration was both a series of events in April -- May 1660 and the period that followed it in British history . In 1660 the monarchy was restored to the kingdoms of England , Ireland and Scotland in the person of Charles II . The period that followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms was officially declared an Interregnum . , Charles II -LRB- 29 May 1630 -- 6 February 1685 -RRB- was king of England , Scotland and Ireland . He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651 , and king of England , Scotland and Ireland from the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 until his death .   Charles II 's father , Charles I , was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649 , at the climax of the English Civil War . Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649 , England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth , and the country was a de facto republic , led by Oliver Cromwell . Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 , and Charles fled to mainland Europe . Cromwell became virtual dictator of England , Scotland and Ireland , and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France , the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands . A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy , and Charles was invited to return to Britain . On 29 May 1660 , his 30th birthday , he was received in London to public acclaim . After 1660 , all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649 .   Charles 's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code , designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England . Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance . The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War . In 1670 , he entered into the secret treaty of Dover , an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France . Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension , and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date . Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence , but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it . In 1679 , Titus Oates 's revelations of a supposed `` Popish Plot '' sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles 's brother and heir -LRB- James , Duke of York -RRB- was a Catholic . The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties . Charles sided with the Tories , and , following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683 , some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile . Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681 , and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685 . He was received into the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed .   Charles was popularly known as the Merry Monarch , in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans . Charles 's wife , Catherine of Braganza , bore no live children , but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses . He was succeeded by his brother James . ",

Since becoming active in the film industry , Reeves has earned critical acclaim . One New York Times critic praised Reeves ' versatility , saying that he `` displays considerable discipline and range ... he moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles '' . However , Reeves has spent much of his later career being typecast . A recurring character arc in many roles he has portrayed is one of saving the world , as can be seen in the characters of Ted Logan , Buddha , Neo , Johnny Mnemonic , John Constantine , and Klaatu . His acting has garnered several awards , including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .   During his film career , Reeves has engaged in several forms of artistic expression .

    "evidence": "Congress veteran Sheila Dikshit, credited with transforming Delhi into a modern, contemporary city during her three terms as its chief minister, died on Saturday after a cardiac arrest.  Dikshit, who was 81 years old, had been ailing for sometime and her death was mourned by politicians cutting across party lines. Dikshit, who is survived by her son, politician Sandip, and daughter Latika, was admitted to Delhi\u2019s Fortis Escorts Heart Institute on Saturday morning in a \u201ccritical condition with cardiac arrest\u201d, a statement by the hospital said. \u201cA multi-disciplinary team of doctors, led by Dr Ashok Seth, Chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, carried out advanced resuscitative measures.  Her condition stabilised temporarily.  However, she had another cardiac arrest and despite all the resuscitative efforts, passed away at 3:55pm on July 20, 2019,\u201d said the statement. The Delhi government declared two days of mourning in the national capital in homage to Dikshit,the longest-serving chief minister of the city-state.  She will be accorded a state funeral on Sunday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said. President Ram Nath Kovind, vice president M Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, his sister and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, former prime minister Manmohan Singh and Delhi chief minster Arvind Kejriwal were among the many who condoled the death of Dikshit, known as an affable politician with a reputation as an able administrator from her uninterrupted reign as Delhi\u2019s chief minister from 1998 to 2013. The who\u2019s who of Delhi visited the East Nizamuddin residence of Dikshit, where her body was brought at 5. 30pm amid chants of \u201cSheila Dikshit Amar Rahe\u201d (Long Live Sheila Dikshit).  The Delhi Congress said her body will be taken from her residence to the Congress headquarters on Akbar Road at 11. 30am on Sunday after which the last rites would be performed at the Nigambodh Ghat at 2. 30pm. Many political figures recalled her contribution to Delhi, where she is credited for bringing the metro railway network and turning it into the city\u2019s lifeline, the flyovers and underpasses that came with it, her efforts to make power supply more efficient by reforming the distribution network and the achievement of turning the capital\u2019s fleet of fuel-guzzling, smoke-emitting buses and auto rickshaws into CNG vehicles that made the capital\u2019s air cleaner, at least for a few years. \u201cDeeply saddened by the demise of Sheila Dikshit Ji.  Blessed with a warm and affable personality, she made a noteworthy contribution to Delhi\u2019s development,\u201d Modi tweeted. WATCH: Delhi\u2019s longest-serving CM Sheila Dikshit passes away, tributes pour inRahul Gandhi said he was devastated by news of her death.  \u201cA beloved daughter of the Congress Party, with whom I shared a close personal bond.  My condolences to her family & the citizens of Delhi, whom she served selflessly as a three-term chief minister, in this time of great grief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSheila ji will always be remembered for her years of exemplary governance and immense contribution to the development of Delhi,\u201d Priyanka Gandhi wrote.  \u201cI will miss her wise counsel, her sweet smile and the warmth with which she would hug me whenever we met. \u201d\u201cAn able administrator, she made immense contribution to the development of Delhi.  Apart from many other achievements in her long career in public life, Sheila-ji will be remembered as a fine human being,\u201d senior BJP leader LK Advani said. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been at odds with Dikshit many times, wrote in a Twitter post: \u201cJust now got to know about extremely terrible news about the passing away of Sheila Dikshit ji.  It\u2019s a huge loss for Delhi and her contribution will always be remembered.  My heartfelt condolences to her family members.  May her soul rest in peace. \u201dRecalling his last meeting with his predecessor, Kejriwal said, \u201cThe news of the sudden demise of Mrs Sheila Dikshit ji has shocked me.  Only last month I had met her for nearly an hour when she came with her party\u2019s delegation to submit a memorandum on several issues, at the end of the meeting I wished her good health, not knowing that this would be my last meeting with her. \u201dIt was Kejriwal\u2019s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that contributed to ending Dikshit\u2019s resign as chief minister in 2013, when her Congress government fell under the weight of anti-incumbency against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre and her own administration amid a raft of corruption allegations, including in the organisation of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Although the Congress suffered a humiliating defeat, winning just eight out of the 70 assembly seats, it struck an alliance with AAP to form a coalition government that lasted just 47 days.  In the subsequent assembly elections in 2015, the Congress, led by Ajay Maken, failed to open its account.  AAP won 67 seats and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) the remaining three. Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Dikshit was named the Delhi Congress president, a post she held until her death. During her tenure as the Delhi unit chief, Dikshit had frequent run-ins with All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge PC Chacko \u2013 first over a proposed alliance with AAP for the Lok Sabha elections and over some organisational appointments. Dikshit vehemently opposed any tie-up with the AAP and the central leadership of the Congress went by her opinion; neither party won a single seat in Delhi, which elects seven members of Parliament.  She unsuccessfully fought the Lok Sabha elections from the North-East Delhi constituency. In July 2016, she was named the Congress party\u2019s chief ministerial candidate for the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party won a landslide.  Dikshit served as the Kerala governor from March 5, 2014 to August 26, 2014. In the last election she contested, she was defeated by Manoj Tiwari of the BJP who, like everyone else, had good things to say about Dikshit. \u201cThough we were political rivals and our views were opposite on many issues, I found Mrs Dikshit to be warm and an affectionate person whenever we met,\u201d Tiwari said.

    "evidence": "Filming began in April 2013; Jaa was announced as co-director the same month. After three months of filming, production came to an abrupt halt with only 20% of the film complete. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49\u201350 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures in September 2013, claiming that Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting the role of Kiet in \"Fast and Furious 7\". Sahamongkol based their sum on the cost of launching Jaa's career and loss of future earnings, plus an additional 7.5% interest. They attempted to halt the release of \"Fast and Furious 7\" in Thailand, and on March 27, 2015, a civil court approved, blocking release the film until a settlement had been reached by both parties. The court came to its decision after interviewing two employees of Sahamongkol: Akarapol Karasaranee, the son of the company's president, Somsak Techaratanaprasert; and Suwat Apaipak, a member of Sahamongkol's legal team. In response to the allegations, Jaa stated that his contract with Sahamongkol had ended. He claimed that it was terminated through his lawyer in 2013, describing it as \"business slavery\" due to its allegedly overrestrictive terms and conditions. Sahamongkol claimed that the contract had been renewed for another ten years, through 2023. In the suit, Sahamangkol also requested that Jaa pay back his salary for \"A Man Will Rise\", reportedly \u0e3f26 million ($722,000). The legal matters surrounding the lawsuit have prevented the completion of the film, and although the lawsuit was dropped in July 2015, the film remains unfinished. There are currently no plans to complete the film.Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 or Fast Seven) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the seventh installment in \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. \"Furious 7\" follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in \"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again.",

Republican Reps.  Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Trey Hollingsworth of Indiana, Will Hurd of Texas, John Katko of New York and Tom Reed of New York. \n\n  The resolution \u201cstrongly urges the Department of Defense to not reinstate President Trump\u2019s ban\u201d and \u201cto maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces. \u201d\n\n  In January, the\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0allowed Trump\u2019s transgender military ban to go into effect, in a blow to activists who say the ban is discriminatory, irrational and cruel.  \n\n  Trump first announced the ban on Twitter in July 2017 and said the reasoning was the \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. \u201d \n\n  The policy was later released by then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis in 2018, and it blocks individuals who have been diagnosed with a condition known as gender dysphoria from serving with limited exceptions.  It specifies individuals without the condition can serve, but only if they do so according to the sex they were assigned at birth. \n\n  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Trump administration\u2019s ban \u201can act of cruelty\u201d in a speech on the House floor and said, \u201cthe men and women who step forward to serve in the US military are patriots, all of them. \u201d\n\n  \u201cThe House will continue to fight this discriminatory action, which has no place in our country,\u201d the California Democrat said.  \u201cWe will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security. \u201d\n\n  Democratic Rep.  Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, who introduced the legislation, said at a news conference on Thursday, \u201cWe must confront the fact that still, in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, there are members of our society, Americans, that still do not have the freedom to be free for who they are. \u201d\n\n  Kennedy said, \u201chere in our country if you can wear the uniform, if you can meet those standards, then your contribution counts, your government\u2019s got your back. \u201d \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. \n\nCNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Ariane de Vogue and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.  \n\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.

    "evidence": "Like the banana, the avocado is a climacteric fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree. Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at until they reach their final destination. Avocados must be mature to ripen properly. Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground. Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards. Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at room temperature (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of ethylene gas). Some supermarkets sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening. The use of an ethylene gas \"ripening room\", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of Escondido, California, in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them \"back in the bin,\" and moving on without making a purchase. In some cases, avocados can be left on the tree for several months, which is an advantage to commercial growers who seek the greatest return for their crop, but if the fruit remains unpicked for too long, it falls to the ground.BULLET::::- Bhakar\n\nBULLET::::- Bhulla\n\nSection::::List of Tribes Pind Dadan Khan & Jhelum.:C.\n\nBULLET::::- Chauhan\n\nBULLET::::- Chaudhry\n\nSection::::List of Tribes Pind Dadan Khan & Jhelum.:D.\n\nBULLET::::- Dhamray\n\nBULLET::::- Daudal\n\nSection::::List of Tribes Pind Dadan Khan & Jhelum.:G.\n\nBULLET::::- Ghugh\n\nBULLET::::- Gondal\n\nSection::::List of Tribes Pind Dadan Khan & Jhelum.:H.\n\nBULLET::::- Hal\n\nBULLET::::- Hitmal\n\nSection::::List of Tribes Pind Dadan Khan & Jhelum.:J.\n\nBULLET::::- Jatt Athroo is the major caste of the village owning major chunk of agriculture land.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "A post accompanying a video of Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh\u2019s meeting with Mukesh Ambani is being widely shared across social media platforms with a claim that Captain met Mukesh Ambani to discuss the concerns of the agitating farmers over new farm bills. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The video is from 2017 when Punjab CM Amarinder Singh met Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai to discuss various investment and industrial development opportunities in Punjab. This video has nothing to do with the recent farmer\u2019s protests. Also, there are no recent news reports mentioning that Punjab CM met Mukesh Ambani to discuss the concerns of the agitating farmers.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. YouTube search with the keywords \u2018Captain Amarinder Singh met Mukesh Ambani\u2019 led us to a 2017 news video which carried visuals similar to the video in the post. According to the report, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh met industrialist Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai and discussed various investment and industrial development opportunities in Punjab. Taking a cue from the news video, Google search with relevant keywords led us to a 2017 news article which reported the meeting between the Captain and Mukesh Ambani. According to this news article, Punjab CM met Mukesh Ambani one-to-one followed by delegation-level talks during which Reliance made a detailed presentation on business. It is noteworthy to mention that in their meeting, business opportunities in the farm sector were also discussed. Further, Amarinder Singh shared few images of their meeting on social media which can be seen here and here. Also, we could not find any recent news articles about Punjab CM\u2019s meeting with Mukesh Ambani to discuss the agitating farmers\u2019 concerns. In the wake of the farmers\u2019 protest led by Punjab farmers over the new farm bills, posts like these are being widely circulated on social media with misleading claims. To sum it up, a 2017 video of Amarinder Singh\u2019s meeting with Mukesh Ambani is falsely shared as a recent meeting to discuss farmers concerns. ",

    "evidence": "\"No one should have to choose between their right to vote and their health. \"How to vote safely in person according to CDC guidelinesMask-wearing, social distancing and good hand hygiene will continue to play their part in minimizing COVID-19 risk as millions head to the polls during a global pandemic.  But voters can also expect to encounter new protocols, tools and, in some cases, polling sites to help keep people safe. \"No one should have to choose between their fundamental right to vote and their health,\" Hannah Klain, a fellow with the nonpartisan law and policy institute Brennan Center for Justice, told ABC News. Here's a look at some of the safety measures in play this election season. Social distancing will continue to be enforced at polling sites, such as through markers on the ground, to help keep voters spaced 6 feet apart while they wait in line to cast their ballot. Experts advise that a long line may not mean a long wait time, just that the polling site is enforcing social distancing and managing crowd size. Some counties, including in Texas, North Carolina and Nevada, are implementing online wait-time technology so you can see the anticipated wait at your polling site and avoid peak times. Curbside voting is not a new practice, with states like Virginia offering the car service for elderly and disabled voters.  It may be a more popular option this election in states and counties where it's offered.  Some states, including North Carolina, have expanded curbside voting to anyone who wants to use it. This year, Harris County in Texas created a drive-thru voting option using portable voting machines to provide a \"safer, socially-distant alternative to walk-in voting. \" As of Wednesday, more than 70,000 voters had voted across 10 locations, according to the county clerk.  Voters with disabilities are also eligible for curbside voting at all polling sites in the county, which includes Houston. Madison Square Garden in New York, Fenway Park in Boston and Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, are just some of the stadiums debuting as polling places this election.  The venues allow for ample social distancing, and, for those that are outdoors, optimal ventilation. Plastic partitions at check-in are among the Bipartisan Policy Center and Cleveland Clinic's recommendations for safe voting.  And so far, plexiglass between voters and poll workers is a common sight at polling places across the country. Plastic sheets between voting booths are also being installed at some polling sites to help protect voters. \"Ballot-marking procedures should be established to minimize viral transmission,\" the Brennan Center and the Infectious Diseases Society of America advised in their guidance for healthy in-person voting. That might look like Q-tips, finger covers or other disposable devices.  Harris County has opted for disposable plastic finger covers that voters can use while touching voting machines this election. Voters may also want to bring their own supplies, such as a pen or stylus for touchscreen machines, the organizations recommend.  Just make sure to verify with an election official before using your own supplies, they note. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "evidence": "Star Wars : Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales . It is the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy , and stars Ewan McGregor , Natalie Portman , Hayden Christensen , Ian McDiarmid , Samuel L. Jackson , Christopher Lee , Temuera Morrison , Anthony Daniels , Kenny Baker , and Frank Oz .   The film is set ten years after the events in Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace . The galaxy is on the brink of civil war . Led by a former Jedi named Count Dooku , thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic . After Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala evades assassination , Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker becomes her protector , while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates the attempt on Padm\u00e9 's life . Soon Anakin , Padm\u00e9 , and Obi-Wan witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy , the Clone Wars .   Development of Attack of the Clones began in March 2000 , after the release of The Phantom Menace . By June 2000 , Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script and principal photography took place from June to September 2000 . The film crew primarily shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney , Australia , with additional footage filmed in Tunisia , Spain and Italy . It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a high-definition digital 24-frame system .   The film premiered on May 16 , 2002 . Some critics hailed it as an improvement over The Phantom Menace , while the visual effects , costume design , musical score , and Ewan McGregor 's performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi were all praised . Despite this , critics lambasted the romance of Anakin and Padm\u00e9 , the dialogue , most of the acting , and the film 's long runtime . The film received positive reviews and was a financial success ; however , it also became the first Star Wars film to be out-grossed in its year of release , placing only third domestically and fourth internationally . The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 12 , 2002 and was later released on Blu-ray on September 16 , 2011 . Following Attack of the Clones , the third and final film of the prequel trilogy , Star Wars : Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith , premiered in 2005 . ",

With 215000 sqkm , Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay , Suriname and French Guiana -LRB- an overseas region of France -RRB- .

    "claim": "The Beach Boys had songs chart worldwide.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne , California , in 1961 . The group 's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson ; their cousin Mike Love ; and their friend Al Jardine . Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era . The group , led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian , pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production , combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R&B to create their unique sound . He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles , often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways .   The Beach Boys began as a garage band managed by the Wilsons ' father Murry , with Brian 's increasingly sophisticated songwriting and recording abilities dominating their creative direction . Emerging at the vanguard of the `` California Sound '' , they performed original material that reflected a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance . After 1964 , they abandoned the surfing aesthetic for more personal lyrics and multi-layered sounds . In 1966 , the Pet Sounds album and `` Good Vibrations '' single vaulted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era . Following the dissolution of the group 's Smile project in 1967 , Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band , reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues . The group 's public image subsequently faltered , and despite efforts to continue their psychedelic/avant-garde ventures and reclaim their hippie audiences , they were dismissed as an embodiment of the values and outlooks shared by early 1960s white , suburban teenagers .   The continued success of their greatest hits albums during the mid 1970s precipitated the band 's transition into an oldies act , a move that was denigrated by critics and many fans . Since the 1980s , much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties , songwriting credits and use of the band 's name transpired . Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998 . After Carl 's death , many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects . Even though Wilson and Jardine have not performed with Love and Johnston 's band since their one-off 2012 reunion tour , they remain a part of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Inc. .   The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed , commercially successful , and widely influential bands of all time . The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide , thirty-six of them US Top 40 hits -LRB- the most by an American rock band -RRB- , four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide , making them one of the world 's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at No. 12 on Rolling Stone magazine 's 2004 list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' . The core quintet of the three Wilsons , Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomas . The disease usually begins in the lungs , skin , or lymph nodes . Less commonly affected are the eyes , liver , heart , and brain . Any organ , however , can be affected . The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved . Often there are no , or only mild , symptoms . When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing , cough , shortness of breath , or chest pain . Some may have L\u00f6fgren syndrome in which there is fever , large lymph nodes , arthritis , and a rash known as erythema nodosum .   The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown . Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed . Those with affected family members are at greater risk . Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms , which may be supported by biopsy . Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides , high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level , or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme -LRB- ACE -RRB- in the blood . The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis .   Many people clear up without any treatment within a few years . However some may have long term or severe disease . Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen . In cases where the condition causes significant health problems steroids such as prednisone are indicated . Alternatively , medications such as methotrexate , chloroquine , or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids . The risk of death is between one and seven percent . There is a less than five percent chance of the disease returning in someone who has had it previously .   In 2015 pulmonary sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease affected 1.9 million people globally and they resulted in 122,000 deaths . It is most common in Scandinavians but occurs in all parts of the world . In the United States risk is greater among black as opposed to white people . It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 . It occurs more often in women than men . Sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by the English doctor Jonathan Hutchinson as a non painful skin disease . ",

    "evidence": "Michael Joseph Jackson -LRB- August 29 , 1958 -- June 25 , 2009 -RRB- was an American singer , songwriter , record producer , dancer , actor , and philanthropist . Called the `` King of Pop '' , his contributions to music , dance , and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades .   The eighth child of the Jackson family , Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 . He began his solo career in 1971 . In the early 1980s , Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music . His music videos , including those of `` Beat It '' , `` Billie Jean '' , and `` Thriller '' from his 1982 album Thriller , are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool . The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame . Jackson 's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles `` I Just Ca n't Stop Loving You '' , `` Bad '' , `` The Way You Make Me Feel '' , `` Man in the Mirror '' , and `` Dirty Diana '' , becoming the first album to have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 . He continued to innovate with videos such as `` Black or White '' and `` Scream '' throughout the 1990s , and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist . Through stage and video performances , Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques , such as the robot and the moonwalk , to which he gave the name . His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres .   Thriller is the best-selling album of all time , with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide . Jackson 's other albums , including Off the Wall -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , Bad -LRB- 1987 -RRB- , Dangerous -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , and HIStory -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , also rank among the world 's best-selling albums . He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records .

Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism , and , in 2000 , the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities , more than any other entertainer .   Aspects of Jackson 's personal life , including his changing appearance , personal relationships , and behavior , generated controversy . In 1993 , he was accused of child sexual abuse , but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought . In 2005 , he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts . While preparing for his comeback concert series , This Is It , Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25 , 2009 , after suffering from cardiac arrest . The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide , and his personal physician , Conrad Murray , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter . Jackson 's death triggered a global outpouring of grief , and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world . Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity , with earnings of $ 825 million in 2016 , the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication . ",

    "evidence": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA or sometimes USEPA -RRB- is an agency of the Federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress . President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2 , 1970 , after Nixon signed an executive order . The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate . The agency is led by its Administrator , who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress . The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt . The EPA is not a Cabinet department , but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank .   The EPA has its headquarters in Washington , D.C. , regional offices for each of the agency 's ten regions , and 27 laboratories . The agency conducts environmental assessment , research , and education . It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws , in consultation with state , tribal , and local governments . It delegates some permitting , monitoring , and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes . EPA enforcement powers include fines , sanctions , and other measures . The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts .   In 2016 , the agency had 15,376 full-time employees . More than half of EPA 's employees are engineers , scientists , and environmental protection specialists ; other employees include legal , public affairs , financial , and information technologists . In 2017 the Trump administration proposed a 31 % cut to the EPA 's budget to $ 5.7 billion from $ 8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs . , Richard Milhous Nixon -LRB- January 9 , 1913 -- April 22 , 1994 -RRB- was an American politician who served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 until 1974 , when he became the only U.S. president to resign from office . He had previously served as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 under the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower , and prior to that as a U.S. Representative and also Senator from California .   Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California . After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College , he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law . He and his wife Pat moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government . He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II . Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence . He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president -- at 40 , the second-youngest vice president in history . He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962 . In 1968 , he ran for the presidency again and was elected by defeating incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey .   Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home , and ended the military draft . Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year . His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states . He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days , enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing , which signaled the end of the moon race . He was reelected in one of the largest electoral landslides in U.S. history in 1972 , when he defeated George McGovern .   The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo , gasoline rationing , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal . The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office . After his resignation , he was issued a pardon by his successor , Gerald Ford . In retirement , Nixon 's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image . He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 . ",

Macau was returned to China in 1999 . , The Portuguese Empire -LRB- Imp\u00e9rio Portugu\u00eas -RRB- , also known as the Portuguese Overseas -LRB- Ultramar Portugu\u00eas -RRB- , was one of the largest and longest-lived empires in world history and the first colonial empire of the Renaissance . It existed for almost six centuries from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 to the grant of sovereignty to East Timor in 2002 .   The first era of the Portuguese empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery . Initiated by the Kingdom of Portugal , it would eventually expand across the globe . Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418 -- 19 , using recent developments in navigation , cartography and maritime technology such as the caravel , in order that they might find a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice trade . In 1488 , Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope , and in 1498 , Vasco da Gama reached India . In 1500 , either by an accidental landfall or by the crown 's secret design , Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral discovered Brazil on the South American coast .   Over the following decades , Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia , establishing forts and factories as they went . By 1571 , a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki along the coasts of Africa , the Middle East , India and South Asia . This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth -LRB- 1500-1800 -RRB- , when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal 's per capita income .   When Philip II of Spain , I of Portugal , inherited the Portuguese crown in 1580 , this began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal that has since been given the historiographic term of the Iberian Union . Though the realms continued to be administered separately , the Council of Portugal ruled the country and its empire from Madrid . As the King of Spain was also King of Portugal , Portuguese colonies became the subject of attacks by three rival European powers hostile to Spain : the Dutch Republic , England , and France . With its smaller population , Portugal was unable to effectively defend its overstretched network of trading posts , and the empire began a long and gradual decline . Eventually , Brazil became the most valuable colony of the second era until , as part of the wave of independence movements that swept the Americas during the early 19th century , it broke away in 1822 .   The third era represents the final stage of Portuguese colonialism after the decolonization of the Americas of the 1820s . The colonial possessions had been reduced to the African coastline -LRB- expanded inland during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century -RRB- , Portuguese Timor , and enclaves in India -LRB- Goa -RRB- and China -LRB- Macau -RRB- .

He had been playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary before making his first film in 1917 , but had to leave the country after the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919 . He had roles in several films in Weimar Germany before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship .   In 1927 , he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of Bram Stoker 's novel . He later appeared in the classic 1931 film Dracula by Universal Pictures . Through the 1930s , he occupied an important niche in popular horror films , with their East European setting , but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire , and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting .   Meanwhile , he was often paired with Boris Karloff , who was able to demand top billing . To his frustration , Lugosi was increasingly restricted to minor parts , kept employed by the studio principally for the sake of his name on the posters . Among his pairings with Karloff , only in The Black Cat -LRB- 1934 -RRB- , The Raven -LRB- 1935 -RRB- , and Son of Frankenstein -LRB- 1939 -RRB- did he perform major roles again , and , even in The Raven , Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role . By this time , Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic neuritis , and he became addicted to morphine and methadone . This drug dependence was noted by producers , and the offers eventually dwindled down to a few parts in Ed Wood 's low-budget movies , most notably Plan 9 from Outer Space . ",

Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team 's court under organized rules . It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964 .   The complete rules are extensive .

The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court . The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively . Typically , the first two touches are used to set up for an attack , an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court .   The rally continues , with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches , until either -LRB- 1 -RRB- : a team makes a kill , grounding the ball on the opponent 's court and winning the rally ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- : a team commits a fault and loses the rally .

Special counsel report delivered, focus shifts to attorney generalSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's report into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election  did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr. The letter describes \"two main\" Russian efforts to influence the election  including \u201cattempts by a Russian organization\u2026 to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States\u201d and \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations\u201d targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party. In both circumstances, the \u201cSpecial Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts. \u201dThe special counsel\u2019s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. \"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" the letter read.  \"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. \"In his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. \u201dWhile Mueller\u2019s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr\u2019s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted. \u201cIn cataloging the President\u2019s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \"Barr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions. The White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \"exoneration. \"\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday.

KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \"\"The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.  \"Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction.  The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States. \u201dJay Sekulow, one of President Trump\u2019s lawyers, told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos that the report was a \"complete win for the president and the American people. \"\"Not just a win. \" Sekulow said.  \"The entire basis upon which this inquiry was instituted was a concern over collusion between the Russian government and the trump campaign, Bob Mueller and the Department of Justice could not be clearer.

Y. , questioned the timing of the letter tweeting \"Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice.  Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ. \" He later tweeted that \"in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,\" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling Barr in to testify in the near future. In his letter to members of Congress on Sunday, Barr described the breadth of the special counsel\u2019s extensive and exhaustive probe.  Mueller\u2019s 19 prosecutors and 40 FBI agents issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, Barr wrote, the results of which amounted to 37 indictments and six guilty pleas to date. The news comes amid Democrats continued calls for the full release of the findings. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint letter, seemed to sum up the sentiment of many congressional Democrats in saying that Barr's letter \"raises as many questions as it answers\" and that Congress \"requires the full report and the underlying documents. \"\"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,\" they wrote.  \"Given Mr.  Barr\u2019s public record of bias against the Special Counsel\u2019s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report. \"The congressional leaders also took issues with the president's claims of being \"exonerated. \"On the campaign trail and on the Hill, Democrats made clear they are going to want every detail and document about the investigation and some have said they are willing to use their subpoena power in order to get it. \"It means make the request, if the request is denied subpoena, if the subpoenas are denied we will hold people before the Congress and yes, we will prosecute in court as necessary to get this information,\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Sunday on \"This Week\". Democratic candidates running to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted quickly to the news that Mueller delivered his report to DOJ with one consistent message: Make it public. \"The Mueller report must be made public \u2014 all of it,\" Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY said in a presidential campaign speech outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City. She added: \"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether their president is a crook. \"The much-awaited report was handed to the Justice Department for Barr\u2019s review, and Congress was notified of the transfer late Friday afternoon, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman. After reviewing Mueller's report, Barr will then send what he has described as his own \"report\" on the Mueller investigation to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.  Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be. In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law. \"A senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments. Mueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts. At the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets.  Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations. In appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump. Trump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt. \u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description. At least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation. Another Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow.  And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016. By then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail.  And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016. But claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI. \u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers. Several weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin. Some of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications.  Page has never been charged with any crimes. The wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office.  After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail. Rosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation. And then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey. The move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe. Comey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go. \u201dMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts. However, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors. The U. S.  Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs. Cohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.

Special counsel report delivered, focus shifts to attorney generalSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's report into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election  did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr. The letter describes \"two main\" Russian efforts to influence the election  including \u201cattempts by a Russian organization\u2026 to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States\u201d and \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations\u201d targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party. In both circumstances, the \u201cSpecial Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts. \u201dThe special counsel\u2019s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. \"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" the letter read.  \"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. \"In his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. \u201dWhile Mueller\u2019s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr\u2019s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted. \u201cIn cataloging the President\u2019s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \"Barr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions. The White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \"exoneration. \"\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday. He tweeted: \"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION.

    "evidence": "Rajya Sabha member Jaya Bachchan on Friday questioned the delay in the hanging of the four men convicted of raping and torturing the 23-year-old woman more than seven years ago in Delhi. The four men were convicted in Tihar Jail for the rape and murder of the young woman on a bus in New Delhi on December 16, 2012, in a crime which brought thousands out on the streets in protest and led to the changing of the law to deal with sex offenders in the country. \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied.  Even today, one person is free.  Have his intentions changed today? \u201d she asked. The lawmaker was referring to the juvenile, also convicted in the case, who was later released in 2015 after he served three years in a correctional home. The minor was among the six people who gang-raped and fatally assaulted the woman.  Prime accused Ram Singh, the bus driver, committed suicide in 2013.  Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma were hanged simultaneously inside Tihar Jail number 3 at 5:30am for the Delhi 2012 gang-rape and murder of the young woman. Before this, the Samajwadi Party leader had said that those accused of rape must be lynched. She had made the comments in the Upper House after a 26-year-old Hyderabad vet was allegedly raped and killed by four men and her charred body was found in Telangana\u2019s Ranga Reddy district in December last year. \u201cI think the people now want the government to give a proper answer and a very definite answer.  What has happened?  How they have tackled it and how far justice has been done to these people? \u201d Jaya Bachchan had asked. Several, including the woman\u2019s parents and Union ministers, talked about the delay in the hangings but said justice was served. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said he wished \u201cthis could have been done earlier\u201d.  \u201cToday is also the day to reflect by the judiciary, govt, civil society that should some people convicted for capital punishment be allowed to manipulate the system to delay it for seven years,\u201d Prasad as quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Union minister Smriti Irani also pointed out to the delay. \u201cJustice was delayed but it has finally been delivered.  This is a message to all those who think they can commit crimes against women and escape the law,\u201d Irani said, according to ANI. Rekha Sharma, the chairperson of National Commission for Women (NCW), too talked about the years it took for the execution to be held. \u201cAn example has been set today but it could have been done earlier.  Now people know that they will be punished, you may extend the date but you will get punished,\u201d Sharma said, according to ANI. The execution of the four convicts brought the curtains down on the drama surrounding the hanging that saw the death warrants cancelled thrice on various grounds over the last two-and-a-half months.  The hanging was carried after a three-judge Supreme Court bench rejected the final plea by the convicts\u2019 lawyer to stay their execution in a late-night hearing on Thursday. ",

It is the world 's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world , with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1 % of the global population , known as Muslims . Islam teaches that God who is merciful , all-powerful , and unique has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , viewed by Muslims as the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative example -LRB- called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith -RRB- of Muhammad -LRB- 570 -- 8 June 632 CE -RRB- .   Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses , and Jesus . As for the Quran , Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous are punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the five pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam .   Islam originated in the early 7th century in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Islamic empire extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century when much of the historically Islamic world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing . The expansion of the Muslim world involved various caliphates and empires , traders and conversion to Islam by missionary activities .   Most Muslims are of one of two denominations : Sunni -LRB- 75 -- 90 % -RRB- or Shia -LRB- 10 -- 20 % -RRB- . About 13 % of Muslims live in Indonesia , the largest Muslim-majority country , 31 % in South Asia , the largest population of Muslims in the world , 23 % in the Middle East-North Africa , where it is the dominant religion , and 15 % in Sub-Saharan Africa .

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Katharine Houghton Hepburn -LRB- May 12 , 1907 -- June 29 , 2003 -RRB- was an American actress . Known for her fierce independence and spirited personality , Hepburn was a leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years . She appeared in a range of genres , from screwball comedy to literary drama , and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress -- a record for any performer . In 1999 , Hepburn was named by the American Film Institute as the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema .   Raised in Connecticut by wealthy , progressive parents , Hepburn began to act while studying at Bryn Mawr College . After four years in the theatre , favorable reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood . Her early years in the film industry were marked with success , including an Academy Award for her third picture , Morning Glory -LRB- 1933 -RRB- , but this was followed by a series of commercial failures that led her to be labeled `` box office poison '' in 1938 . Hepburn masterminded her own comeback , buying out her contract with RKO Radio Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story , which she sold on the condition that she be the star . In the 1940s , she was contracted to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer Tracy . The screen-partnership spanned 25 years and produced nine movies .   Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life , as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles . She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters , such as in The African Queen -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , a persona the public embraced . Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner -LRB- 1967 -RRB- , The Lion in Winter -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , and On Golden Pond -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . In the 1970s , she began appearing in television films , which became the focus of her career in later life . She remained active into old age , making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87 . After a period of inactivity and ill health , Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96 .   Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine and refused to conform to society 's expectations of women . She was outspoken , assertive , athletic , and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so . She married once , as a young woman , but thereafter lived independently . A 26-year affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public . With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen , Hepburn epitomized the `` modern woman '' in the 20th-century United States and is remembered as an important cultural figure .

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp -LRB- March 19 , 1848 -- January 13 , 1929 -RRB- was an American Old West gambler , a deputy sheriff in Pima County , and deputy town marshal in Tombstone , Arizona Territory , who took part in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral , during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys . He is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone , although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day , and had far more experience as a sheriff , constable , marshal , and soldier in combat .   Earp lived a restless life . He was at different times a constable , city policeman , county sheriff , Deputy U.S. Marshal , teamster , buffalo hunter , bouncer , saloon-keeper , gambler , brothel keeper , miner , and boxing referee . Earp spent his early life in Iowa . In 1870 , Earp married his first wife , Urilla Sutherland Earp , who contracted typhoid fever and died shortly before their first child was to be born . During the next two years Earp was arrested for stealing a horse , escaped from jail , sued twice , and was arrested and fined three times during the course of 1872 for `` keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame '' . His third arrest was subject of a lengthy account in the `` Daily Transcript '' which referred to him as an `` old offender '' and nicknamed him the `` Peoria Bummer '' .   By 1874 he had arrived in the cattle boomtown of Wichita , Kansas where his brother had opened a brothel . On April 21 , 1875 he was appointed to the Wichita police force , and developed a solid reputation as a lawman . In April 1876 he was dismissed from his position as a lawman following an altercation with a political opponent of his boss which led to him being fined $ 30 . In 1876 , he followed his brother James to Dodge City , Kansas , where he became an assistant city marshal . In winter 1878 , he went to Texas to track down an outlaw and met John `` Doc '' Holliday , whom Earp later credited with saving his life .   Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another . He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil , where a silver boom was underway . There , the Earps clashed with a loose federation of outlaws known as the Cowboys . Wyatt , Virgil , and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury , and Ike and Billy Clanton , who threatened on several occasions to kill the Earps . The conflict escalated over the next year , culminating on October 26 , 1881 in the gunfight at the O.K. Corral , in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the Cowboys . In the next five months , Virgil was ambushed and maimed , and Morgan was assassinated . Pursuing a vendetta , Wyatt , his brother Warren , Holliday , and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible . Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights in which he took part , unlike his brothers Virgil and James , or his friend , Doc Holliday , which only added to his mystique after his death .   Earp was a lifelong gambler and was always looking for a quick way to make money . After leaving Tombstone , Earp went to San Francisco where he reunited with Josephine Earp . She became his common-law wife . They joined a gold rush to Eagle City , Idaho , where they owned mining interests and a saloon . They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego , California . Back in San Francisco , Wyatt raced horses again , but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight . They moved briefly to Yuma , Arizona before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899 . In partnership with Charlie Hoxie they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $ 80,000 -LRB- about $ 2 million in 2017 dollars -RRB- . Returning to the lower 48 , they opened another saloon in Tonopah , Nevada , the site of a new gold find . In about 1911 , Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal , California , retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles .   Wyatt Earp died on January 13 , 1929 . He was known as a Western lawman , gunfighter , and boxing referee . He had a notorious reputation for both his handling of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight and his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight . This only began to change after his death when an extremely flattering biography was published in 1931 . It became a bestseller and created his reputation as a fearless lawman . Since then , Earp has been the subject of and model for numerous films , TV shows , biographies , and works of fiction that have increased his notoriety . He did , however , live to see himself being portrayed in the film Wild Bill Hickok , released in 1923 . Long after his death , he has many devoted detractors and admirers . Earp 's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West 's `` toughest and deadliest gunman of his day . '' , A constable is a person holding a particular office , most commonly in criminal law enforcement . The office of constable can vary significantly in different jurisdictions . A constable is commonly the rank of an officer within the police . Other persons may be granted powers of a constable without holding the title of constable . , Municipal police are law enforcement agencies that are under the control of local government . This includes the municipal government , where it is the smallest administrative subdivision . They receive funding from the city budget , and may have fewer legal powers than the `` state paid '' police . These police forces usually report to the Mayor or a local police board . , The United States Marshals Service -LRB- USMS -RRB- is a federal law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Justice -LRB- see -RRB- . It is the oldest American federal law enforcement agency , which was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 during the presidency of George Washington . The Marshals Service is attached to the Judicial branch of government , and is the enforcement arm of the federal courts . It is the primary agency for fugitive operations , responsible for prisoner transport , the protection of officers of the court , and for the effective operation of the judiciary . The Marshals Service operates the Witness Protection Program , and serves federal level arrest warrants . ",

Before his career as a politician , Lukashenko worked as director of a state-owned agricultural farm and spent time with the Soviet Border Troops and the Soviet Army . He was the only deputy to vote against the independence of Belarus from the Soviet Union .   Lukashenko opposed Western-backed `` shock therapy '' during the post-Soviet transition . He has retained Soviet-era policies , such as continued state ownership of key industries , despite objections from Western governments . Observers also contend that Lukashenko presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia . Belarus has been labeled `` Europe 's last dictatorship '' by some Western journalists , on account of Lukashenko 's self-described authoritarian style of government . Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials are also the subject of sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States for human rights violations off and on since 2006 . ",

    "evidence": "Across the images, the meme text reads: \u201cI\u2019m not judging. . . I\u2019m just showing you pictures of Jacob Blake. \u201dMore examples of the post are available on Facebook here, here and here and on Twitter here and here. Video footage shows a white police officer shooting Blake at close range while Blake tried to get into a car on August 23 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. \u00a0Blake, 29, was left likely paralyzed from the waist down. Coming three months after the death of\u00a0George Floyd, the incident involving Blake was the latest US police shooting of a black man and sparked unrest in Kenosha.  Campaigning for November\u2019s election, President Donald Trump condemned \u201canti-police rhetoric\u201d and dismissed anti-racism protests as \u201cdomestic terror\u201d during a visit to the traumatized city.  His Democratic challenger Joe Biden also visited Kenosha and met with Blake\u2019s father. Photos of Blake circulated widely after he was shot, and he does not closely resemble the boy in the photo collage. AFP Fact Check reverse image searched the collage of photos, which yielded an August 2, 2020 tweet with the image collage but without the text overlay about Blake.  The caption identifies the person pictured as \u201cthe young man shot by police a few weeks ago in Chicago,\u201d not Kenosha, where Blake was shot. Searching the bottom right image of the collage with the term \u201cChicago\u201d yields a blog post dated April 13, 2016 containing two images in the posts.  The blog says the pictures show Pierre Loury, a 16-year-old boy who was fatally shot by Chicago police on April 11, 2016. Searching for the uncaptioned collage with results limited from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the year Loury was killed, shows it was shared as early as April 15, 2016.  This was four years before Blake was shot and five days after what police called an \u201carmed confrontation\u201d with Loury. Images from news coverage of a memorial for Loury show that he resembled\u00a0the boy pictured in the collage, while Blake does not. However, Andrew Stroth, Loury\u2019s family lawyer, told AFP that he \u201ccannot confirm the identity\u201d after reviewing the photos. ",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "Shortly before the beginning of World War II, the ship, St Louis, left Nazi Germany, carrying on board more than 900 Jewish refugees, who were trying to escape anti-Semitic persecution. United States (US), Canada, and Cuba refused to admit the refugees, forcing St. Louis to turn back for Europe. Historians now estimate that at least a quarter of the refugees aboard the St. Louis were eventually murdered in the Holocaust.Events such as these are legion in the annals of World War II. For these, and other reasons, after the end of the war, an international treaty concerning the rights of refugees was drafted and signed by many nations. At the core of international refugee law is the principle of non-refoulement \u2014 that is, refugees fleeing persecution on racial, ethnic, religious, or other grounds, may not be deported back to their country of origin, where their lives will be in danger.While India is not a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention Protection, it is by now widely accepted that the principle of non-refoulement has acquired the status of customary international law, i.e., it is binding on all States that make up the community of nations. This principle was affirmed in an important judgment by the Manipur high court (HC) on May 3, 2021, in a case concerning the status of seven Myanmarese refugees, who had fled to India after the military coup in their home country.Also Read | UN welcomes US President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to admit more refugees this yearIn granting the refugees safe passage to Delhi so that they could apply to the UN High Commission for Refugees for a formalisation of their status, the Manipur HC correctly held that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution \u2014 which guarantees to all persons the right to life and personal liberty \u2014 included within it the right to non-refoulement.Over the last four decades, the Indian judiciary has achieved worldwide renown for its generous interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution, expanding it to include a panoply of rights that protect the dignity and freedom of the individual. Relying upon that storied history, the Manipur high court held that Article 21 would continue to apply even in the case of refugees, who had fled to India seeking sanctuary from persecution.The high court\u2019s judgment is particularly important, especially when considered in light of the Supreme Court (SC)\u2019s inaction in a similar case. For the last four years \u2014 well before the coup \u2014 the Rohingya community in Myanmar has been subjected to genocidal persecution and ethnic cleansing, a fact that was provisionally accepted last year by the International Court of Justice.Since 2017, a petition has been pending in SC, asking the court to clarify that the principle of non-refoulement is part of the Indian Constitution, and that therefore, the government should not deport refugees back to Myanmar without a determination of their status. However, not only has SC not decided the case, but \u2014 in two interim orders \u2014 allowed deportation to go ahead, pending final resolution. This is starkly reminiscent of the actions of the US and Canadian governments in turning away St. Louis, and consigning Jewish refugees to a terrible fate.Indeed, the Manipur HC is not the first Indian HC to have held that Article 21 protects the right to non-refoulement. The Gujarat and Delhi HCs have also done so, and indeed, the Manipur HC drew upon a rich tradition of Indian jurisprudence that guarantees the basic rights of refugees, in passing its judgment.Thus, it is perhaps in the teeth of the Supreme Court\u2019s inaction that the high court\u2019s judgment stands out as a beacon of judicial courage and principle, in protecting the rights \u2014 and indeed, the lives \u2014 of the most vulnerable.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocateThe views expressed are personal Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon -LRB- \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd , Lakeda\u00edm\u014dn -RRB- , while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia , in south-eastern Peloponnese . Around 650 BC , it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece .   Given its military pre-eminence , Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars . Between 431 and 404 BC , Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War , from which it emerged victorious , though at a great cost of lives lost . Sparta 's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta 's prominent role in Greece . However , it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC . It then underwent a long period of decline , especially in the Middle Ages , when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras . Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives .   Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution , which completely focused on military training and excellence . Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates -LRB- Spartan citizens , who enjoyed full rights -RRB- , mothakes -LRB- non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans -RRB- , perioikoi -LRB- freedmen -RRB- , and helots -LRB- state-owned serfs , enslaved non-Spartan local population -RRB- . Spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen , and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle . Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world .   Sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day , as well as in the West following the revival of classical learning . This love or admiration of Sparta is known as Laconism or Laconophilia .  At its peak around 500 BC the size of the city would have been some 20,000 -- 35,000 free residents , plus numerous helots and perioikoi -LRB- `` dwellers around '' -RRB- . At 40,000 -- 50,000 it was one of the largest Greek cities ; however , according to Thucydides , the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000 -- 610,000 , making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 5th century BC . The French classicist Fran\u00e7ois Ollier in his 1933 book Le mirage spartiate -LRB- `` The Spartan Mirage '' -RRB- warned that a major scholarly problem regarding Sparta is that all the surviving accounts of Sparta were written by non-Spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of Sparta . Ollier 's theory of the `` Spartan mirage '' has been widely accepted by scholars . ",

    "evidence": "Dopamine -LRB- DA , contracted from 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine -RRB- is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several important roles in the brain and body . It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA , which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys . Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals .   In the brain , dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter -- a chemical released by neurons -LRB- nerve cells -RRB- to send signals to other nerve cells . The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways , one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior . Most types of rewards increase the level of dopamine in the brain , and many addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity . Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones . These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory .   Outside the central nervous system , dopamine functions primarily as a local chemical messenger . In blood vessels , it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator -LRB- at normal concentrations -RRB- ; in the kidneys , it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas , it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system , it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system , it reduces the activity of lymphocytes . With the exception of the blood vessels , dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it .   Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system , and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine . Parkinson 's disease , a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment , is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra . Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured , and in its pure form marketed as Levodopa is the most widely used treatment for the condition . There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity , and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity . Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents . Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- are associated with decreased dopamine activity . Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses , but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD . Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection : although it can not reach the brain from the bloodstream , its peripheral effects make it useful in the treatment of heart failure or shock , especially in newborn babies .

    "evidence": "\n  President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Russian-born business associate he worked on the Trump Tower Moscow project with will both be returning to Capitol Hill next month to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, which is ramping up its probe of the proposed project. \n\n  Cohen was interviewed for more than seven hours behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, and the committee\u2019s chairman, Democrat Adam Schiff of California, announced Cohen would be returning on Wednesday next week to finish his testimony. \n\n  In addition, Schiff said that the committee would hold a hearing in public on March 14 with Felix Sater, the Russian-born onetime business associate of Trump\u2019s who worked on the Moscow Trump Tower project with Cohen.  Schiff said that the committee \u201cis going to try to do as much as we can in the open\u201d with Sater. \n\n  Cohen\u2019s scheduled return, on March 6, is the date he was originally supposed to report to prison to begin serving a three-year sentence.  A judge allowed his report date to be delayed two months, in part due to a request from Cohen\u2019s attorney to give him time to prepare for his congressional testimony. \n\n  Thursday\u2019s developments come on the heels of blockbuster public testimony from Cohen, delivered in a televised hearing of the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.  During that hearing, Cohen harshly criticized the President and accused him of directing the crimes Cohen committed, while Trump\u2019s GOP allies worked to counter his criticisms and undermine his credibility, in part by pointing to the fact that he has pleaded guilty to previously lying to Congress about how long discussions of a Trump Tower project in Moscow extended into the 2016 campaign.  \n\n  Cohen spoke on a range of subjects involving his dealings with Trump during his public testimony, from what Cohen described as Trump\u2019s involvement in hush-money payments to women to his knowledge of longtime confidant Roger Stone\u2019s efforts to contact WikiLeaks.  \n\n  Cohen\u2019s appearance before the House Intelligence Committee will be a much quieter event due to the fact that it will take place behind closed doors.  The session is expected to focus on topics related to the panel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties between Russia and Trump associates. \n\n  The White House has joined with Republican allies in attacking Cohen\u2019s credibility and dismissing what he has to say amid his testimony on the Hill.  The White House said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s closed-door hearing that it was \u201claughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word. \u201d\n\n  Schiff told CNN before Thursday\u2019s testimony that his committee would \u201cdrill down\u201d on a number of the topics that came up during Wednesday\u2019s hearing, as well as ask about a \u201cnumber that were not raised. \u201d The California Democrat didn\u2019t specify but said the House Intelligence Committee would be \u201cdoing a lot of the painstaking work of identifying the source\u2019s corroboration. \u201d\n\n  Asked if he believes Trump had committed crimes, Schiff said that the Southern District of New York implicated him.  \u201cWhat we saw (Wednesday) was those crimes continued while he was in the Oval Office,\u201d Schiff said on the public hearing. \n\n  Intelligence Committee lawmakers said they expected the closed-door interview to last most of the day Thursday, after Cohen testified for roughly nine hours on Tuesday and more than seven hours on Wednesday. \n\n  Rep.  Mike Conaway, a senior Republican on the committee, said Cohen had laid out areas he would not discuss in Thursday\u2019s interview, though Conaway would not elaborate on specifics. \n\n  The White House has joined with Republican allies in attacking Cohen\u2019s credibility and dismissing what he has to say amid his testimony on the Hill.  The White House said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s closed-door hearing that it was \u201claughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word. \u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers ask Justice Department to investigate Michael Cohen for perjury\n\n\n  Republicans took their charges against Cohen a step further Thursday, when Republican Reps.  Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina sent the Justice Department a criminal referral of Cohen for possible prosecution, claiming to have evidence that Cohen committed perjury in his testimony. \n\n  Meadows and Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department to investigate Cohen\u2019s statements Wednesday that he did not seek a job in the Trump White House, his denial of committing bank fraud, as well as his assertion that the did not have any reportable contracts with foreign entities. \n\n  Democrats on the Oversight Committee have dismissed Republican accusations that Cohen lied.  Rep.  Jamie Raskin of Maryland told CNN Thursday morning that the line of questioning from his Republican colleagues was an \u201cirrelevant distraction. \u201d\n\n  CNN has reached out to Cohen\u2019s attorneys and the Justice Department for comment. \n\n  Cohen\u2019s Capitol Hill testimony may be one of the last chances that lawmakers and the public have to hear from the President\u2019s ally turned adversary before he reports to prison.  \n\n  Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence on May 6, a date that was pushed back by two months in part because his lawyer requested more time for Cohen to prepare for his congressional testimony. \n\n  He was sentenced in December for tax crimes, campaign finance violations tied to hush money payments to women and lying to Congress during his 2017 testimony about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower Moscow extended into the 2016 campaign. \n\n  Earlier in the week, Cohen appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for another closed-door session, testifying for roughly nine hours on Tuesday.   \n\n  The main event, however, came on Wednesday with Cohen\u2019s public testimony before the House Oversight Committee.  \n\n  In a fiery televised hearing, Cohen called Trump \u201ca racist,\u201d \u201ca conman\u201d and \u201ca cheat. \u201d He alleged that Trump had knowledge of Stone\u2019s efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks ahead of the release of hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign and discussed Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in hush-money payments to women.  Cohen told the committee that there was \u201cno doubt in his mind\u201d that Trump knew he was paying Cohen for \u201chush money payments. \u201d\n\nThe 29 most consequential lines from Michael Cohen's congressional testimony\n\n  Cohen provided new details claiming Trump was heavily involved in the pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project in 2016. \n\n  \u201cTo be clear, Mr.  Trump knew of and directed the Trump Tower negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Cohen said.  \u201cHe lied about it because he never expected to win the election.  He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. \u201d\n\n  Cohen said that Trump did not \u201cdirectly\u201d tell him to lie to Congress, but that Trump would tell him personally and the public that he had \u201cno business\u201d with Russia, even as he was negotiating the Moscow project. \n\n  \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie,\u201d Cohen said. \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. \n\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.

    "evidence": "Who is responsible for Mumbai\u2019s mess? The answer is simple: Years of apathy under successive governments that sought to treat the city as a cash machine, rather than a living ecosystem. The city of dreams, whose engine is powered by money, does not have enough of anything \u2014 roads, housing, buses and trains, schools, hospitals, parks and public places. Before the lockdown last March, an average of seven people lost their lives, daily, on the railway tracks of the city\u2019s famed suburban network. But the city that never sleeps chugged on nevertheless, just as it is, now, with an average of 16 deaths from Covid-19 a day for the past week. What the world takes for resilience \u2014 evident in that completely inappropriate term for people who go through hell just to make a living, the spirit of Mumbai \u2014 is largely resignation. Extraneous factors may have driven Mumbai\u2019s (and Maharashtra\u2019s) Covid-19 trajectory in the first wave. A mutant strain of the virus that\u2019s more infectious is probably driving the second. These are beyond any government\u2019s control. But restrictions that make work, life, play, travel safe for people are well within the state government\u2019s remit. It was only on Sunday evening that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government decided to impose a weekend lockdown, restrict the use of public transport to 50% of its capacity, and order the closure of theatres, malls, religious places, among other steps, till April 30. This was necessary, and if anything, is too delayed and partial. The right time to impose these restrictions would have been March 1. As opposed as this newspaper is to the idea of a complete lockdown \u2014 it makes sense only if the period is used to strengthen health infrastructure, or arrest a raging wave that is threatening to go out of control \u2014 Maharashtra may well require a short, hard lockdown to make up for that lapse. The power to open up vaccines to all, meanwhile, is with the Centre. Vaccinating a million people in Maharashtra a day for the next three weeks will cover at least a fourth of its adult population. Yet, New Delhi has been happy to watch the state government fail spectacularly. Given its connectedness to the rest of the country, it is just a matter of time before the fire in Mumbai spreads. Both the state and the central government must act, now. Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

    "evidence": "As mass shootings have become a disturbingly regular occurrence in the United States, so too have heated discussions about the weapon used in many of the worst incidents of the past decade, AR-15 firearms and their offshoots. Discussions about guns in America tend to be politically fraught, and so too is the terminology surrounding them. A frequent misconception about AR-15 firearms, for instance, is that the \u201cAR\u201d in the name stands for \u201cassault rifle.\u201d It does not. AR stands for ArmaLite Rifle, reflecting the company name (ArmaLite) of the original manufacturer of the weapon. Although ArmaLite sold the design of the rifle to Colt in 1959, the term \u201cAR-15\u201d has persisted and acts as a catch-all for similar guns, even though various models with different manufacturers have different names. ArmaLite developed the weapon in the 1950s with the original intention that it would be used by the military but didn\u2019t have much success selling it before handing it off to Colt. As NPR reports, Colt had widespread success selling the automatic M-16 to the military, which troops used in Vietnam. Colt produced a semi-automatic, civilian version of that weapon and marketed it as the \u201cAR-15.\u201d \u201cWhen Colt\u2019s patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models,\u201d NPR reported. \u201cThose gun makers gave the weapons their own names, yet the popularity of the AR-15 turned it into a generic term for all types of AR-15-style rifles.\u201d Myre, Greg.\u00a0\u201cA Brief History of the AR-15.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0NPR.\u00a028 February 2019.

The RJD leadership was initially sceptical about the idea of contesting the polls due later this year. Many within the party felt the RJD should not put up candidates and rather support secular parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP rules Assam and emerged as the main challenger to ruling TMC in West Bengal after becoming the second-largest party in the state in the 2019 polls.\u201cWe want an alliance with TMC as our first choice.

In this scenario, RJD\u2019s alliance with secular parties could benefit the secular bloc,\u201d said Siddiqui.The RJD has been contesting three to four seats in West Bengal. An RJD candidate was elected from the Bura Bazaar assembly segment in Kolkata in 2006. The RJD has identified seats in Asansol, Kolkata, and Kharagpur to contest in the 2021 elections.The people cited above said in case talks with TMC on seat arrangement do not materialise, the RJD would then approach the Left-Congress alliance.In Assam, the RJD delegation will meet representatives of AIUDF for a possible alliance. \u201cWe want to contest 10-12 seats in Assam.

It is the world 's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 396 passengers , with a range of 5240 to . Commonly referred to as the `` Triple Seven '' , its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft , six wheels on each main landing gear , fully circular fuselage cross-section , and a blade-shaped tail cone . Developed in consultation with eight major airlines , the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between Boeing 's 767 and 747 . As Boeing 's first fly-by-wire airliner , it has computer-mediated controls . It was also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design .   The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths . The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995 , followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997 . The stretched 777-300 , which is 33.25 ft longer , followed in 1998 . The initial 777-200 , -200 ER and -300 versions are equipped with General Electric GE90 , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines . The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively , while the 777F , a freighter version , debuted in February 2009 ; these variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips . The 777-200LR is the world 's longest-range airliner , able to fly more than halfway around the globe , and holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft .   The 777 first entered commercial service with United Airlines on June 7 , 1995 . It has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner ; as of April 2017 , 60 customers had placed orders for 1,911 aircraft of all variants , with 1,484 delivered . The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 725 delivered and 815 orders ; Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet , with 157 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2016 . The 777 has been involved in six hull losses as of October 2016 ; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service .   The 777 ranks as one of Boeing 's best-selling models . Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes . Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300 , the Airbus A350 XWB , and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 . The 787 Dreamliner , which entered service in 2011 , shares design features and a common type rating for pilots with the 777 . In November 2013 , Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants , collectively named 777X , featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787 . The new 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020 . ",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "Investigating the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leg of Kerala gold smuggling scandal, a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) reached Dubai on Sunday night to interrogate key accused - Faisal Fareed - and collect evidence gathered by the authorities there, people familiar with the development said. Apart from Fareed, who used to send gold in the diplomatic baggage from Dubai, the two-member NIA team will question a couple of other suspects as well who have been taken into custody by the Dubai police, the officials said. A senior official cited above, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, said that Fareed\u2019s firm was contracted in the UAE to clear and send the diplomatic baggage to India. It is also suspected that Fareed is the one who had set up a network of hawala dealers and couriers who helped in disposing of/selling the gold. He originally hails from Kerala but resides in the UAE. The anti-terror probe agency had last month also approached the Interpol seeking a \u201cblue notice\u201d against Fareed. It was found that Fareed had forged the documents - seal and emblem - of the UAE embassy to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage and the gold coming here was to be used for terror activities. During its stay in Dubai, the NIA team will also seek details of shell companies, which were used for transferring the money, as well as hawala operators linked to gold smuggling. The UAE authorities are learnt to have conducted substantial investigation already on India\u2019s request and are likely to hand over its findings to the NIA team. The federal anti-terror probe agency is probing \u201cterror angle\u201d in the large scale smuggling of gold in Kerala.Apart from Faisal Fareed and Swapna Suresh, NIA has identified K T Ramees as the mastermind of the whole racket. Ramees is currently in judicial custody. Last week, it had arrested Muhammad Ali, a Popular Front of India (PFI) member. The outfit, however, denied Ali being associated with it. In all, NIA has arrested 10 accused in the case so far, including Swapna Suresh, who helped in air consignment of UAE consulate at Thiruvananthapuram in which 30 kg gold was recovered last month. The agency had informed a court last week that prime accused Swapna Suresh had a strong connection with Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan\u2019s office. A larger terror conspiracy is being probed by multiple agencies \u2013 NIA, ED and Customs. The NIA had said earlier that \u201cthe accused persons had conspired to damage the monetary stability of India by destabilising the economy by smuggling large quantity of gold from abroad and it is suspected that they had used these proceeds of smuggling for financing terrorism through various means\u201d. It has further claimed that \u201cusing diplomatic baggage of UAE as a cover to transact illegal business may have serious repercussions in the diplomatic relations with the government of UAE and it is prejudicial to the monetary and economic security of India as well.\u201d Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

    "evidence": "Motorola -LRB- -LSB- \u02ccmo\u028at\u0259\u02c8ro\u028al\u0259 -RSB- -RRB- was an American multinational telecommunications company founded on September 25 , 1928 , based in Schaumburg , Illinois . After having lost $ 4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009 , the company was divided into two independent public companies , Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4 , 2011 . Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola , as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off . Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo in 2014 .   Motorola designed and sold wireless network equipment such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers . Motorola 's home and broadcast network products included set-top boxes , digital video recorders , and network equipment used to enable video broadcasting , computer telephony , and high-definition television . Its business and government customers consisted mainly of wireless voice and broadband systems -LRB- used to build private networks -RRB- , and public safety communications systems like Astro and Dimetra . These businesses -LRB- except for set-top boxes and cable modems -RRB- are now part of Motorola Solutions . Google sold Motorola Home -LRB- the former General Instrument cable businesses -RRB- to the Arris Group in December 2012 for US$ 2.35 billion .   Motorola 's wireless telephone handset division was a pioneer in cellular telephones . Also known as the Personal Communication Sector -LRB- PCS -RRB- prior to 2004 , it pioneered the `` mobile phone '' with DynaTAC , `` flip phone '' with the MicroTAC as well as the `` clam phone '' with the StarTAC in the mid-1990s . It had staged a resurgence by the mid-2000s with the RAZR , but lost market share in the second half of that decade . Later it focused on smartphones using Google 's open-source Android mobile operating system . The first phone to use the newest version of Google 's open source OS , Android 2.0 , was released on November 2 , 2009 as the Motorola Droid -LRB- the GSM version launched a month later , in Europe , as the Motorola Milestone -RRB- .   The handset division -LRB- along with cable set-top boxes and cable modems -RRB- was later spun off into the independent Motorola Mobility . On May 22 , 2012 , Google CEO Larry Page announced that Google had closed on its deal to acquire Motorola Mobility . On January 29 , 2014 , Page announced that pending closure of the deal , Motorola Mobility would be acquired by Chinese technology company Lenovo for US$ 2.91 billion -LRB- subject to certain adjustments -RRB- . On October 30 , 2014 , Lenovo finalized its purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google . ",

    "claim": "Jammu and Kashmir: Security tightened in Jammu ahead of #IndependenceDay tomorrow. https://t.co/LDyWRPqNB7",
    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "Once upon a time Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was prime time\u2019s favourite hunting ground. Rampaging broadcast hosts stomped all over it to proclaim who was patriotic and who was anti-national. Now, these anchors have diverted all their energy to the camp wars of the film industry and the Kashmir story is a forgotten headline, pulled out every now and then from the archives to make a larger point about nationalism. The specificities of the situation, whether it is militancy, the key players, the restoration of statehood or the prolonged detention of mainstream politicians is too substantive and serious to find any space in salacious, gossipy television noise. Perhaps that explains the absence of any real attention to the political exit of a young man once embraced, even by the Right-wing, as the great new hope. When Shah Faesal, a doctor, topped the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), his posters were juxtaposed with those of Burhan Wani, killed in an anti-terror operation in 2016. Faesal was the perfect antidote to the trope of the educated local militant. For every story about the school topper who picked up the gun, there was Faesal, the somewhat shy, mild-mannered brainiac who had encouraged an entire generation of young Kashmiris to find a future, not just within the Indian Constitution, but within the government. This year too,16 Kashmiri candidates cleared the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) selection process. Faesal, who had famously captured the binary forced on his ilk by admitting that politicians from the (erstwhile) state were slotted as either \u201cseparatists or stooges\u201d, made a low-key departure from electoral politics. All he would say is that \u201cthings in Kashmir had changed forever\u201d.Why are we not more worried? Why are we not more puzzled? A year after the effective nullification of Article 370, nobody believes that the special status of the state will be restored and almost everybody believes that its statehood will be returned. But what no one knows is what we have achieved by the abject humiliation of those who stood by our Union and Constitution. Sure, some of them may have flirted with autonomy and slogans of self-rule. And others were propped up by support from New Delhi. And, yes, J&K\u2019s mainstream politicians have to reflect on why there was such little support on the street for them. But by rubbing their noses in the ground and handing an entire generation of young separatists an \u201cAha-we-told-you-so moment\u201d, what precisely has been gained? Faesal is not the only politician who once had the approval of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to have fallen out of favour. An even more dramatic example is that of Sajjad Lone, brother and son of separatists. If his father was assassinated by those affiliated to Pakistan, for being willing to talk peace with a BJP government (Atal Bihari Vajpayee was prime minister), the son walked many more steps in that direction by fielding candidates in the 2002 assembly elections. Later, he called Prime Minister Narendra Modi his brother and openly allied with the BJP. Lone was known to be a favourite among Kashmir-watchers of the Sangh parivar. He has not uttered a word since his release from detention. And then there are former chief minister Omar Abdullah\u2019s candid remarks in a new book, India Tomorrow. Speaking to authors Pradeep Chhibber and Harsh Shah, Abdullah reveals the absolute sense of \u201canger, frustration, resentment and bitterness\u201d he felt about being locked up. At the heart of his bewilderment is \u201cwhy\u201d. What had he done and what did jailing him do for Kashmir? He even goes so far as to indicate that he may not remain in electoral politics if statehood is not brought back. \u201cI do not see myself being the chief minister of a Union Territory,\u201d he tells the authors, adding that such an entity does not even have the power to appoint a peon. In some ways, the BJP has achieved its political end. By shifting the goalpost to the restoration of statehood and domicile laws, the government has deftly ensured that literally no party is talking about special status any more. A bunch of petitions in the Supreme Court could take years to adjudicate. And every single mainstream politician has already made peace with the fact that Article 370 is not coming back. But if that debate is buried, it is even less explicable why we need to weaken political activity. The BJP promised that the end of Article 370 was going to be the close of business-as-usual in Kashmir. But if anything defines business-as-usual, it has been New Delhi\u2019s attempts at political engineering in the Valley. The humiliation of the mainstream politician is one such illustration. If J&K is truly integrated, why are we so fearful of democratic lawful politics? Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

Its neighbours include China -LRB- officially the People 's Republic of China , PRC -RRB- to the west , Japan to the northeast , and the Philippines to the south .  Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations , and also possesses the largest economy of any state outside of the UN .   The island of Taiwan , also known as Formosa , was mainly inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the 17th century , when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island to Han Chinese immigration . After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning , the island was annexed by the Qing dynasty , the last dynasty of China . The Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War . While Taiwan was under Japanese rule , the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- was established on the mainland in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty . Following the Japanese surrender to the Allies in 1945 , the ROC took control of Taiwan . However , the resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC 's loss of the mainland to the Communists , and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC continued to claim to be the legitimate government of China , its effective jurisdiction since 1949 has been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding islands , with the main island making up 99 % of its de facto territory . As a founding member of the United Nations , the ROC continued to represent China at the United Nations until 1971 , when the PRC assumed China 's seat , causing the ROC to lose its UN membership .   In the early 1960s , Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization , creating a stable industrial economy . In the 1980s and early 1990s , it changed from a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system . Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy in the world , and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy . It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press , healthcare , public education , economic freedom , and human development . The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree .   The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence . Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC . Today only a few smaller nations recognize the ROC as the sole legal representative of China , but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates . Although Taiwan is fully self-governing , most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor . Internally , the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence , though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal . The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible . ",

McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish -- American War , raised protective tariffs to promote American industry , and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals .   McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War , and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier , beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major . After the war , he settled in Canton , Ohio , where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton . In 1876 , he was elected to Congress , where he became the Republican Party 's expert on the protective tariff , which he promised would bring prosperity . His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial ; which together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office , led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890 . He was elected Ohio 's governor in 1891 and 1893 , steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests . With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna , he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896 , amid a deep economic depression . He defeated his Democratic rival , William Jennings Bryan , after a front-porch campaign in which he advocated `` sound money '' -LRB- the gold standard unless altered by international agreement -RRB- and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity .   Rapid economic growth marked McKinley 's presidency . He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition , and in 1900 , he secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act . McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict , but when negotiation failed , he led the nation into the Spanish -- American War of 1898 ; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive . As part of the peace settlement , Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines ; Cuba was promised independence , but at that time remained under the control of the U.S. Army . The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory .   Historians regard McKinley 's 1896 victory as a realigning election , in which the political stalemate of the post -- Civil War era gave way to the Republican-dominated Fourth Party System , which began with the Progressive Era . McKinley defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election , in a campaign focused on imperialism , protectionism , and free silver . However , his legacy was quickly cut short when he was shot on September 6 , 1901 by Leon Czolgosz , a second-generation Polish-American with anarchist leanings ; McKinley died eight days later , and was succeeded by his Vice President Theodore Roosevelt . As an innovator of American interventionism and pro-business sentiment , McKinley 's presidency is generally considered above average , though his universally positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt . , On September 6 , 1901 , William McKinley , the 25th President of the United States , was shot on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition at the Temple of Music in Buffalo , New York . He was shaking hands with the public when Leon Czolgosz , an anarchist , shot him twice in the abdomen . McKinley died eight days later on September 14 of gangrene caused by the gunshot wounds . He was the third American president to have been assassinated , following Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881 .   McKinley had been elected for a second term in 1900 . He enjoyed meeting the public , and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office . Secretary to the President George B. Cortelyou feared that an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music and took it off the schedule twice . McKinley restored it each time .   Czolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism , a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders . Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression , Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him . Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier , Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple . One bullet grazed McKinley ; the other entered his abdomen and was never found .   McKinley initially appeared to be recovering , but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous , and died early the next morning ; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him . After McKinley 's assassination , for which Czolgosz was sentenced to death in the electric chair , Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the President .

Andrew Cuomo at a birthday party in the Hamptons without a mask on started to circulate on the social media sites such as Parler and Facebook:  We have been unable to determine the source of these pictures, but it doesn\u2019t appear as if they were taken recently. For one, Cuomo didn\u2019t host a party in the Hamptons for his birthday this year. The governor threw a \u201cvirtual\u201d birthday party due to social-distancing restrictions in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuomo\u2019s virtual party, which was also a fundraiser, was criticized by outlets such as the New York Post for having a high-ticket price: A video supposedly showing Cuomo\u2019s \u201cmaskless\u201d birthday party was also circulated on social media. That video, however, was taken in 2019. This rumor also doesn\u2019t stem from any credible news reports. The only information we found about the alleged \u201cmaskless party\u201d came from social media posts on Facebook and Parler. If Cuomo, who has been critical of politicians who have disregarded social-distancing guidelines, truly had attended a maskless party, we\u2019d see ample media coverage of the perceived hypocrisy.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Amid the ongoing agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country, a gory video of police beating up protesters is circulating on social media.  It is being claimed that the video is from Assam where the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has been implemented. India Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and is around seven years old. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Among others, Facebook user 'Syed Samad' posted the video with the caption in Hindi that roughly translates: \"NRC has been implemented in Assam, people are being picked up from their houses.  Media will not show you thisit's now our responsibility to share this video maximum number of times. \"The viral video is disturbing as it shows policemen brutally thrashing people, bodies lying in pools of blood and people running for safety. To verify the claim being spread on social media, the AFWA team observed it closely and found 'RAB' written on the uniforms of the policemen. We ran a Google search and found that RAB or Rapid Action Battalion is an anti-crime and anti-terrorism unit of the Bangladesh Police. We took a screengrab from the video and ran a reverse search to find out that the video is actually from Dhaka, Bangladesh.  We found a similar video with the caption: \"Police raid at Hefazat-e-Islam rally\". At 7 minutes 10 seconds of this video, one can see the body of a man lying on the stairs.  The same image is also visible in the viral video. We ran a search on internet with the keywords -- \"Police raid at Hefazat-e-Islam rally\" -- and found many media reports. According to these reports, on May 6, 2013, Dhaka witnessed a clash between protesters and police over the blasphemy law.  The protest was organised by the group Hefazat-e Islam, demanding an anti-blasphemy law with provision for the death penalty. Hence, it is established that the viral video is from Dhaka and is around seven years old. The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie. ",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "Former finance minister P Chidambaram and his legal team suffered a blow on Thursday when a Delhi court sent him to 14 days\u2019 judicial custody in Tihar jail in the INX Media corruption case, declining to free him on bail after he completed 15 days in the custody of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) .Special judge Ajay Kumar sent Chidambaram to Tihar until September 19, but said that given the fact that the Congress politician is protected by Z Category security, he should be kept in a special cell. The judge also allowed Chidambaram, 73, a Rajya Sabha member, to carry his prescription medicines to jail.His ruling came hours after a Supreme Court bench comprising R Bhanumathi and AS Bopanna denied Chidambaram bail in a case of money laundering being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with INX Media. The apex court told Chidambaram\u2019s legal team that granting him anticipatory bail could frustrate the investigation and maintained that his custodial interrogation was necessary in the case.Watch: Former FM Chidambaram sent to Tihar jail after court rejects bail in INX case\u00a0\u201cGrant of anticipatory bail, particularly in economic offences would definitely hamper the effective investigation. Having regard to the materials said to have been collected by the respondent Enforcement Directorate and considering the stage of the investigation, we are of the view that it is not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail,\u201d the Supreme Court bench said.\u201cHaving regard to the nature of allegations and the stage of the investigation, in our view, the investigating agency has to be given sufficient freedom in the process of investigation,\u201d the bench said in its 57-page judgment.However, the top court was critical of the Delhi high court judge who had delivered the August 20 verdict denying him anticipatory bail for quoting \u201cverbatim\u201d a note produced before him by ED, and said it was \u201cnot a correct approach for consideration of grant/refusal of anticipatory bail\u201d. In a last-ditch effort on Thursday to convince the special judge to keep Chidambaram out of Tihar jail, his legal team said he was even ready to be arrested by the ED, which could take him into its custody to question him.Appearing for the CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that Chidambaram was an influential person in public life, wielded substantial sway over witnesses and there existed potential for tampering with the evidence. He said letters of request had been sent to overseas jurisdictions seeking information in connection with the case and alleged that Chidambaram had used his influence to ensure that the investigating agency did not get the information it had sought. Countering the submissions, Chidambaram\u2019s lawyer Kapil Sibal said that there was no justification for sending his client to judicial custody. He submitted that CBI had not brought anything on record to even suggest that the former minister had ever tried to influence witnesses or interfere in the investigation.With the top court\u2019s order in its favour, the ED can arrest him any time. But the ED decided against making its move on Thursday, leaving special judge Kuhar with two options: to release Chidambaram on bail or remand him to judicial custody.Judge Kuhar ruled in favour of sending him to Tihar. \u201cConsidering the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of offences, stage of investigation, the accused is remanded to judicial custody,\u201d the judge ordered.The judge had heard both sides argue on Chidambaram\u2019s next stop for a little over 30 minutes before he reserved his order. As the two sides waited for him to return with his verdict, Chidambaram looked tired. Like always, he had been standing in the suspect\u2019s box as he waited for the judge to return.A court staffer brought him a chair. It wasn\u2019t the first time that Chidambaram had been offered a chair but he had always, pointedly and firmly, declined. Today, he decided to sit down.His team had been prepared for the verdict, and quickly moved requests.Lawyer Kapil Sibal started with a request that Chidambaram be allowed to carry his spectacles and prescribed medicines to Tihar jail. Chidambaram, who has been the country\u2019s home minister, also requested a separate cell with a bathroom in light of concerns over his security. The judge accepted these two sets of applications. On the third - a formal request to surrender to the ED - the judge issued notice to the agency to make its position clear.Chidambaram is likely to be housed in Tihar\u2019s Jail No. 7, where usually those accused in Enforcement Directorate cases are kept, PTI reported.Chidambaram has already spent 15 days in the custody of the CBI in five separate spells, after his arrest from his Jor Bagh home in New Delhi on August 21. He was arrested after the Supreme Court didn\u2019t accept his request to urgently hear his pleas for anticipatory bail in the INX Media caseThe CBI is probing alleged irregularities in the grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media for receiving foreign investment to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007, when Chidambaram was finance minister in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. CBI registered an FIR in the case on May 15, 2017.INX Media co-founders Peter Mukerjea and his wife Indrani Mukerjea have been charged with entering into a criminal conspiracy with Karti Chidambaram, P Chidambaram\u2019s son, to secure clearance from FIPB for the foreign investment received by the company and evade punitive measures for not having the requisite approvals.Indrani Mukerjea told CBI in March last year that a deal of $1 million had been struck between Karti Chidambaram and the Mukerjeas to secure approval from the FIPB in favour of INX Media. The Chidambarams did receive a measure of relief when special judge OP Saini granted them protection from arrest by the CBI and the ED in the 2006 Aircel Maxis on Thursday. The judge said the two would be released on a Rs 1 lakh bail bond in case either of the two agencies arrested them in the case.The Aircel Maxis case refers to a 2006 investment in Indian telecom company Aircel Ltd by Malaysia\u2019s Maxis Communications Bhd. which, the CBI says, was in violation of the then prevailing foreign investments laws.The CBI alleged that P Chidambaram had cleared an investment of $800 million in Aircel by Maxis although it was the cabinet committee on economic affairs that was the competent authority to grant such approval. This was done by wrongly projecting the deal as merely involving an investment of Rs 180 crore, according to the CBI, which alleged that money had been paid to a company controlled by Karti Chidambaram in return.The Chidambarams have denied all the allegations against them in both the INX Media and Aircel Maxis cases and in turn said the National Democratic Alliance government was waging political vendetta against them.\u201cAs I have been saying it\u2019s a non case. Been dragged into only due to political vendetta. I have no connection to Aircel Maxis or to FIPB. I had an Aircel sim though :) and in time this INX bogey will also be slayed,\u201d Karti Chidambaram wrote on Twitter.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

    "evidence": "De Profundis -LRB- Latin : `` from the depths '' -RRB- is a letter written by Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment in Reading Gaol , to `` Bosie '' -LRB- Lord Alfred Douglas -RRB- .   In its first half Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde 's conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency . He indicts both Lord Alfred 's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes . In the second half , Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ , whom he characterises as a romantic , individualist artist . The letter began `` Dear Bosie '' and ended `` Your Affectionate Friend '' .   Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897 , close to the end of his imprisonment . Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision , physical labour and emotional isolation . Nelson , the new prison governor , thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour . He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write `` for medicinal purposes '' ; each page was taken away when completed , and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions . Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897 .   Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross -LRB- another former lover , loyal friend and rival to `` Bosie '' -RRB- . Ross published the letter in 1905 , five years after Wilde 's death , giving it the title `` De Profundis '' from Psalm 130 . It was an incomplete version , excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family ; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde 's letters . , Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas -LRB- 22 October 187020 March 1945 -RRB- , nicknamed Bosie , was a British author , poet , translator , and political commentator , better known as the friend and lover of Oscar Wilde . Much of his early poetry was Uranian in theme , though he tended , later in life , to distance himself from both Wilde 's influence and his own role as a Uranian poet . Politically he would describe himself as `` a strong Conservative of the ` Diehard ' variety '' . ",

    "evidence": "Denmark on Sunday said India is going to come out of the coronavirus pandemic as one of the \"global winners\", and it was looking forward to majorly expand bilateral cooperation in areas of clean energy, water and food processing under a green strategic partnership.Ambassador of Denmark Freddy Svane said several leading Danish companies were interested in investing in areas like renewable energy, environment, shipping and innovation in India.Svane told PTI that foreign ministers of the two countries are working on an ambitious action plan comprising specific targets to achieve the goals broadly mentioned in the 'India-Denmark Green Strategic Partnership'.The green partnership, finalised at a virtual summit between the prime ministers of the two countries, aims to create a framework for significant expansion of cooperation in areas of renewable energy, environment, economy, climate change and science and technology.\"It is a partnership of the new age as it is really focusing on a green transition,\" Svane said.The Danish ambassador said the two countries are also working on another track called 'advanced plan' focusing on the expansion of cooperation with specific targets in areas of water, energy and financing of projects to be implemented under the green partnership.He said Denmark is looking at offering its expertise to India in preserving as well as ensuring judicious use of water besides boosting cooperation in the production of offshore and onshore wind energy.On post-Covid recovery, Denmark was confident that India was going to come out stronger from the pandemic.\"I think India is going to come out of the pandemic as one of the global winners. The number of Covid-19 cases in India has gone down drastically while in Europe, we have a spike,\" Svane said.\"I am pretty sure that India will be able to sustain the actual development and that will help the country in the long-run. India needs to stand on its own feet; needs to pursue its own interest,\" the envoy added.He said a strong pro-active India is in the interest of the world.Asked whether he was confident of India's post-Covid economic recovery, Svane said he was \"pretty optimistic\".\"India has already proved its capabilities and capacities. India really built the future not only the present by effectively handling the situation (following the pandemic). India also looked at the future. Built some fantastic systems,\" he added.He also mentioned how India reached out to several countries and supplied medicines initially, and is sending coronavirus vaccines now to help them deal with the pandemic.\"India will develop whatever happens. India has now really, I think, realised that we should not just keep ourselves for ourselves, it is not India for India but it is India for the world,\" he said.The Danish envoy said his country was confident of deeper cooperation and collaboration with India in the 'green' initiative as it feels Prime Minister Narendra Modi would like to drive the country's growth and development in a green and sustainable way.Asked about the stalled negotiations between India and the European Union on a free trade agreement, he exuded confidence of forward movement on it.Launched in June 2007, the FTA talks have been stalled since May 2013, when both sides failed to bridge substantial gaps on crucial issues, including data security status for the IT sector.The ambassador also favoured having investment protection pacts between India and European countries.\"Denmark is a free trade loving nation. In order to ensure that companies doing private investments have proper kind of protection, we think it is highly needed. We would like to see progress on it. We were very happy with the last India-EU summit which added some momentum on it,\" he said.India's bilateral investment protection treaties with individual European countries have lapsed in the last few years. The EU wanted the pacts to continue until they are replaced by the FTA which will have provisions for investment protection.The India-EU summit last year resolved to move forward on the long-pending FTA talks.

    "claim": "The Twelfth Doctor is not from a British television show.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The Twelfth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor , the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who . He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi . Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a time travelling , humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body , and in doing so gain a new physical appearance , and with it a distinct new personality ; this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme 's inception in 1963 . Capaldi 's portrayal of the Doctor is a spiky , brusque , contemplative , and pragmatic character who conceals his emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions .   Capaldi made his first , very brief appearance as the Doctor in the show 's fiftieth anniversary special `` The Day of the Doctor '' -LRB- 2013 -RRB- , as one of the thirteen incarnations of the Doctor who are summoned to save Gallifrey from destruction . Capaldi 's first full appearance as the Doctor was at the end of the 2013 Christmas special `` The Time of the Doctor '' . He is accompanied in the eighth and ninth series by companion Clara Oswald -LRB- Jenna Coleman -RRB- . He also appeared in `` For Tonight We Might Die '' , the first episode of the 2016 spin-off series Class . In the tenth series of Doctor Who , he is accompanied by two new companions : Nardole -LRB- Matt Lucas -RRB- and Bill Potts -LRB- Pearl Mackie -RRB- . On 30 January 2017 , Capaldi announced he would be leaving the programme , with the 2017 Christmas episode being his last . , `` The Time of the Doctor '' is an episode of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , written by Steven Moffat and directed by Jamie Payne , and was broadcast as the ninth Doctor Who Christmas special on 25 December 2013 on BBC One . It features the final regular appearance of Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and the first regular appearance of Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor following his brief cameo in `` The Day of the Doctor '' . The episode also features Jenna Coleman as the Doctor 's companion Clara Oswald , plus several enemies of the Doctor , including the Cybermen , Silence , Daleks , and Weeping Angels .   The episode addresses numerous plot threads developed over the course of Smith 's tenure , including the prophecy of the Silence , cracks in the universe , and the Doctor 's fate on the planet Trenzalore , while also dealing with the regeneration limit established in `` The Deadly Assassin '' . `` The Time of the Doctor '' is the ninth Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival , and Matt Smith 's fourth and final Christmas special as the Eleventh Doctor . , `` The Day of the Doctor '' is a special episode of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , marking the programme 's 50th anniversary . It was written by Steven Moffat , an executive producer alongside Faith Penhale . It was shown on BBC One on 23 November 2013 , in both 2D and 3D . The special was broadcast simultaneously in 94 countries , and was shown concurrently in 3D in some cinemas . It achieved the Guinness World Record for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama and won the Radio Times Audience Award at the 2014 British Academy Television Awards .   The 77-minute episode shows the last day of the Time War , in which the War Doctor -LRB- John Hurt -RRB- chooses to kill both Daleks and his own race of Time Lords to end the destructive conflict , paralleling this with a present-day choice by paramilitary organisation UNIT to destroy London rather than allow an alien invasion . Revising the back story , the Doctor succumbs to Clara Oswald 's plea to change his mind ; and instead , at the last instant of the Time War , he hides his war-torn home planet in time , rather than destroy it . Unfortunately , the time distortions incurred leave his past selves with no memory of his changed decision .   The episode starred Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Jenna Coleman as his companion , Clara Oswald . Previous lead actors David Tennant and Billie Piper returned for the episode , Tennant reprising his role as the Tenth Doctor , while Piper portrayed a sentient doomsday weapon called the Moment , projected as an image based on her character Rose Tyler . She is invisible and inaudible to everyone but the War Doctor -LRB- John Hurt -RRB- . Other appearances included a very brief glimpse of the then-upcoming Twelfth Doctor -LRB- Peter Capaldi -RRB- , who would succeed Matt Smith in `` The Time of the Doctor '' , and a guest appearance by Fourth Doctor actor Tom Baker , in his late 70s . Rounding out the guest cast were Joanna Page as Queen Elizabeth I and Jemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart , the daughter of 1970s central figure Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart . The special also featured the return of the Daleks and the Zygons , shape-shifting aliens who had previously appeared only in Terror of the Zygons -LRB- 1975 -RRB- .   As the episode celebrated fifty years of the programme , it referenced and alluded to various concepts featured throughout the show 's run . It has been described by series producer Marcus Wilson as a `` love letter to the fans '' and by the controller of BBC One , Danny Cohen , as an `` event drama '' . ",

This is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn!\u201dHe did not specify but he was probably referring to retaliatory tariffs the Modi government imposed on American goods recently after the United States terminated India\u2019s special trade privileges under a zero-tariff programme, called the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), for denying US companies more access to Indian markets.India had proposed these retaliatory tariffs in response to President Trump\u2019s levies on steel and aluminum goods from all of America\u2019s suppliers in 2018, but had held on to them in the hope of finding a solution to their outstanding trade issue. Talks had been on, but the Trump administration announced GSP termination just days after Prime Minister Modi began his second term.There has been speculation that the United States has been mulling other trade actions against India as well.Trade and tariff issues were discussed during Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s meetings during his India visit earlier in the week and the two sides had agreed to keep talking. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said, \u201cWe need to take a constructive and pragmatic view of issues relating to trade. The real test of our intentions is our ability to address them effectively.\u201dBut President Trump has pushed trade aggressively with all of America\u2019s trading partners, and he now intends to bring it up with the Prime Minister at their upcoming meeting, which will be their first after the Indian leader\u2019s re-election.Ahead of the US president\u2019s departure for Japan and the subsequent tweet, a senior administrative official said the two leaders \u201care expected to discuss their strategic partnership and how best to advance that relationship to the next level\u201d.Trade could dominate that conversation, it appears.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

The capital , and largest city , is Baghdad . The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds ; others include Assyrians , Turkmen , Shabakis , Yazidis , Armenians , Mandeans , Circassians , and Kawliya . Around 95 % of the country 's 36 million citizens are Muslims , with Christianity , Yarsan , Yezidism , and Mandeanism also present . The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish .   Iraq has a coastline measuring 58 km on the northern Persian Gulf and encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain , the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range , and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert . Two major rivers , the Tigris and Euphrates , run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab near the Persian Gulf . These rivers provide Iraq with significant amounts of fertile land .   The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers , historically known as Mesopotamia , is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation . It was here that mankind first began to read , write , create laws , and live in cities under an organised government -- notably Uruk , from which `` Iraq '' is derived . The area has been home to successive civilisations since the 6th millennium BC . Iraq was the centre of the Akkadian , Sumerian , Assyrian , and Babylonian empires . It was also part of the Median , Achaemenid , Hellenistic , Parthian , Sassanid , Roman , Rashidun , Umayyad , Abbasid , Ayyubid , Mongol , Safavid , Afsharid , and Ottoman empires .   Iraq 's modern borders were mostly demarcated in 1920 by the League of Nations when the Ottoman Empire was divided by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres . Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia . A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932 . In 1958 , the monarchy was overthrown and the Iraqi Republic created . Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003 . After an invasion by the United States and its allies in 2003 , Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held in 2005 . The American presence in Iraq ended in 2011 , but the Iraqi insurgency continued and intensified as fighters from the Syrian Civil War spilled into the country . , Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti -LRB- Arabic : \u0635\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a\u064a ; 28 April 1937 -- 30 December 2006 -RRB- was the fifth President of Iraq , serving in this capacity from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003 . A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party , and later , the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Party -- which espoused Ba'athism , a mix of Arab nationalism and socialism -- Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup -LRB- later referred to as the 17 July Revolution -RRB- that brought the party to power in Iraq .   As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr , and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government , Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces . In the early 1970s , Saddam nationalized oil and other industries . The state-owned banks were put under his control , leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the Iran -- Iraq War , the Gulf War , and UN sanctions . Through the 1970s , Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as oil money helped Iraq 's economy to grow at a rapid pace . Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs , a minority that made up only a fifth of the population .   Saddam formally rose to power in 1979 , although he had been the de facto head of Iraq for several years prior . He suppressed several movements , particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements , seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence , and maintained power during the Iran -- Iraq War and the Gulf War . Whereas some in the Arab world lauded Saddam for his opposition to the United States and for attacking Israel -- he was widely condemned for the brutality of his dictatorship . The total number of Iraqis killed by the security services of Saddam 's government in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated at 250,000 .   In 2003 , a coalition led by the U.S. invaded Iraq to depose Saddam , in which U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair accused him of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to al-Qaeda . Saddam 's Ba'ath party was disbanded and elections were held . Following his capture on 13 December 2003 , the trial of Saddam took place under the Iraqi Interim Government . On 5 November 2006 , Saddam was convicted of charges of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'ites , and was sentenced to death by hanging . His execution was carried out on 30 December 2006 . ",

    "evidence": "Dennis Lee Hopper -LRB- May 17 , 1936 -- May 29 , 2010 -RRB- was an American actor , filmmaker , photographer and artist . He attended the Actors Studio , made his first television appearance in 1954 , and soon after appeared alongside James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause -LRB- 1955 -RRB- and Giant -LRB- 1956 -RRB- . In the next ten years he made a name in television , and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films . Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s .   Hopper made his directorial film debut with Easy Rider -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , which he and co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern . The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award for `` Best First Work '' and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay -LRB- shared with Fonda and Southern -RRB- . Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote : `` With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies , Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s , a celluloid anthem to freedom , macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion '' . Film critic Matthew Hays notes that , `` no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper '' .   He worked on various small projects until he found new fame for his role as the American photojournalist in Apocalypse Now -LRB- 1979 -RRB- . He went on to helm his third directorial work Out of the Blue -LRB- 1980 -RRB- , for which he was again honored at Cannes , and appeared in Rumble Fish -LRB- 1983 -RRB- and The Osterman Weekend -LRB- 1983 -RRB- . He saw a career resurgence in 1986 when he was widely acclaimed for his performances in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers , the latter of which saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . His fourth directorial outing came about through Colors -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , followed by an Emmy-nominated lead performance in Paris Trout -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . Hopper found even greater fame for portraying the villains of the films Super Mario Bros. -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , Speed -LRB- 1994 -RRB- and Waterworld -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .   Hopper 's later work included a leading role in the short-lived television series Crash -LRB- 2008 -- 2009 -RRB- , inspired by the Academy Award-winning film of the same name . Production on his final film , The Last Film Festival -LRB- 2016 -RRB- , completed just before his death ; originally slated for 2011 distribution , the project was picked up for theatrical release in late 2016 by Monterey Home Video . Hopper has an additional posthumous credit in the completed , but unreleased Orson Welles drama The Other Side of the Wind , acquired for distribution by Netflix . , Crash is an American television drama series set in Los Angeles , California that starred Dennis Hopper and Eric Roberts . It is the first original series produced by the Starz network . The network ordered a 13 episode season which premiered on October 17 , 2008 . The series is based on the 2004 film of the same name . It was developed for television by Glen Mazzara . In Canada , Crash can be seen on Super Channel . Starz ordered a second season that premiered in September 2009 before concluding in December 2009 .

Senate confirms Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human servicesOn the campaign trail, Joe Biden guaranteed his White House would \"look like the country. \"As he entered the White House, he took steps towards keeping that promise -- assembling a historically diverse slate of top-level nominees. Half of the president's Cabinet picks are women and the majority are people of color.  Biden has noted that many of his selections would be pioneers in their roles -- including the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, the first Black defense secretary, the first openly gay man confirmed to a Cabinet role and the first Native American Cabinet secretary. But before the nominees can break barriers, they have to get through the confirmation process in a closely divided Senate. Here's a look at Biden's picks for the top posts in his administration:Department of JusticeBiden nominated Judge Merrick Garland to serve as the nation's next attorney general on Jan.  7. Garland, 68, serves as a judge on the U. S.  Court of Appeals for the D. C.  Circuit.  He had been nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama to fill the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia, but was never given a confirmation hearing by Senate Republicans who held the vacancy open for President Donald Trump to fill. Garland's nomination came as Democrats won two Senate races in Georgia, paving the way to a smoother confirmation process for Biden's nominees. Confirmed: March 10 by a vote of 70-30. Department of LaborBiden announced Boston Mayor Marty Walsh as his nominee for labor secretary on Jan.  7. Walsh, 53, has served as the Democratic mayor of Boston since 2014.  The pro-union politician had previously served as head of the Boston Trades Council.  Biden spoke at Walsh's 2017 mayoral inauguration and they share Irish-American backgrounds. Biden said he seriously considered Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders for the role but that both decided it was more important for their advancement of a shared political agenda to keep Sanders in the Senate. Confirmed: March 22 by a vote of 68-29. Department of CommerceBiden announced he'd nominate Rhode Island Gov.  Gina Raimondo to commerce secretary on Jan.  7Raimondo, who was first elected governor in 2014 and chaired the Democratic Governors Association in 2019, was one of the women under consideration to be Biden's running mate and was a potential choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Confirmed: March 2 by a vote of 84-15. Department of EducationBiden announced Miguel Cardona as his nominee to head the Department of Education on Dec.  22. Cardona currently serves as Connecticut's commissioner of education -- the first Latino to hold the position.  A former public school teacher and student, he is a strong advocate for public education. Confirmed: March 1 by a vote of 64-33. Environmental Protection AgencyBiden announced Michael Regan as his nominee to head the EPA on Dec.  19. Regan is no stranger to the agency, having previously served nearly a decade there under both Democratic and Republican presidents.  He would be the first African American man to run the EPA if confirmed. Regan is currently secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. Confirmed: March 10 by a vote of 66-34. Department of the InteriorBiden nominated New Mexico Rep.  Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary. At an event on Dec.  19 announcing his latest nominees, Biden noted the significance of having Haaland fill \"a critical role. \"\"As the first Native American Cabinet secretary in the history of the United States of America, she'll be a true steward of our national parks, our natural resources and all of our lands,\" he said.  \"The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial.  With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship. \"Confirmed: March 15 by a vote of 51-40. Department of TransportationBiden announced on Dec.  15 he would nominate Pete Buttigieg to steer the Department of Transportation. At 38, Buttigieg is the youngest of Biden's Cabinet picks so far.  He is also poised to become the first openly gay person confirmed by the Senate to a Cabinet post. Buttigieg is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.  He ran against Biden in the Democratic primary and is seen as a rising star in the party. As transportation secretary, Buttigieg would likely play a key part in implementing Biden's ambitious infrastructure plan, which aims to offset the impacts of climate change. Confirmed: Feb.  2 by a vote of 86-13. Department of EnergyBiden named former Michigan Gov.  Jennifer Granholm as his selection to head the Department of Energy on Dec.  17. Granholm led the Wolverine State during the Great Recession, working with the Obama administration to rescue the U. S.  auto industry while promoting investments in green energy. Granholm has been a strong advocate of zero-emissions vehicles and her selection is seen as an indication that Biden wants the department to play a principal role in fighting climate change. If confirmed by the Senate, Granholm -- an immigrant from Canada -- would be just the second woman to serve as secretary of energy. Confirmed: Feb.  25 by a vote of 64-35. Department of DefenseBiden announced on Dec.  8 he will nominate retired four-star Army Gen.  Lloyd Austin to lead the Department of Defense. Austin previously headed the military's Central Command, where he was in charge of all American troops in the Middle East.  He retired from the military in 2016, after over four decades of service.  Because he is less than seven years removed from active duty, he will require a waiver from Congress to hold the position. If Austin is confirmed, he will become the first Black defense secretary in American history. Confirmed: Jan.  22 by a vote of 93-2. Department of AgricultureBiden, on Dec.  10, announced he will nominate former Iowa Gov.  Tom Vilsack to serve as his secretary of agriculture. Vilsack led the department for eight years during the Obama administration after he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2009.  Prior to that, he served two terms as governor of the Hawkeye State, and he is currently chief executive of the U. S.  Dairy Export Council. Vilsack would be the second member of the Obama administration to reprise their role in Biden's White House, joining Biden's nominee for surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, in returning to their former posts if they are both confirmed by the Senate. Confirmed: Feb.  23 by a vote of 92-7. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentBiden announced on Dec.  10 he will nominate Ohio Rep.  Marcia Fudge to serve as his secretary of housing and urban development. Fudge is a member of the House Agriculture Committee and Committee on Education and Labor.  She is a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and was recently elected to a seventh term in Congress, representing the Cleveland area. Amid the recession brought on by the pandemic, millions of Americans are struggling to pay rent, and federal eviction protections set to expire at the end of 2020.  If confirmed by the Senate, Fudge may be forced to grapple with a housing crisis as she takes office. Confirmed: March 10 by a vote of 64-33. Department of Veterans AffairsDenis McDonough, who served as former President Barack Obama's chief of staff in his second term, will be nominated, Biden said on Dec.  10, to serve as his secretary of veterans affairs. McDonough was previously Obama's principal deputy national security adviser, including during the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.  Prior to his eight-year White House tenure, McDonough served in senior leadership and policy-making positions in both chambers of Congress. He's credited with helping Obama bridge divides on Capitol Hill, including gaining support for the Veterans Choice Act which President Donald Trump later signed into law. Confirmed: Feb.  8 by a vote of 87-7. Department of Health and Human ServicesOn Dec.  6, Biden announced he tapped California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to steer the Department of Health and Human Services, a critical role overseeing the implementation of the Biden administration's coronavirus response. As California's top prosecutor, Becerra took on the Trump administration in more than 100 lawsuits on key issues like health care, immigration, gun control and environmental policies.  Before becoming the state's attorney general, he served 12 terms in Congress, representing Los Angeles. Becerra does not have a background in medicine or public health, but he has established himself as advocate for the Affordable Care Act and women's health care. Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, would be the first Latino to lead the department, if confirmed. Confirmed: March 18 by a vote of 50-49. Department of Homeland SecurityAs part of a rollout of major foreign policy and national security appointments and nominees, Biden announced he would nominate Alejandro Mayorkas for secretary of homeland security on Nov.  23. Mayorkas was born in Havana and came to the United States as a refugee.  If the Senate votes to confirm him to the position, he would be the first Latino and the first immigrant to lead the agency in charge of implementing the nation's immigration policies and border laws. Mayorkas is a veteran of the department; he directed its legal immigration agency and previously served as the deputy secretary of homeland security.  He is also one of the architects behind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). Confirmed: Feb.  2 by a vote of 56-43Department of StateOn Nov.  23, Biden tapped Antony Blinken as his choice for secretary of state. Blinken has advised Biden on foreign policy for almost two decades.  Previously, he served as deputy national security adviser and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration. As the country's top diplomat, Blinken would be expected to play a pivotal part in the Biden administration's efforts to rebuild alliances and reenter international agreements like the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Accord, as well as halt the country's exit from the World Health Organization. Confirmed: Jan.  26 by a vote of 78-22. Department of TreasuryOn.  Nov.  30, Biden named former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as his selection for treasury secretary.  Yellen would be the first woman to serve in the role. Yellen is currently an economist at the Brookings Institution.  She was the first woman to helm the Fed, taking the reins in 2014 as the country recovered from the Great Recession. A labor expert, Yellen is expected to garner support from progressives.  A handful of Senate Republicans who are still in the chamber voted to confirm Yellen to her previous post at the central bank. If confirmed as treasury secretary, Yellen would enter the post during one of the most trying economic times in modern history, with millions of Americans out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic and lagging job growth. Confirmed: Jan.  25 by a vote of 84-15. Director of the Office of Management and BudgetAs part of a rollout of his incoming economic leaders, Biden announced on Nov.  30 he would nominate Neera Tanden to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget. A former aide to Hillary Clinton, Tanden currently serves as president and CEO of the left-leaning Center for American Progress.  She faces an uphill confirmation battle as some Senate Republicans have already indicated her nomination won't pass the chamber's GOP majority, citing her past criticisms of Republican senators whose votes she would need. If confirmed, Tanden would be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to lead the OMB. Withdrawn: March 2 she wrote to the White House, \"It now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities. \"Director of National IntelligenceBiden announced on Nov.  23 that he would nominate Avril Haines as his director of national intelligence. Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA, and served as principal deputy national security adviser under former President Barack Obama.  She was the first woman to hold both of those roles. If confirmed, she will become the first woman to lead the country's intelligence community. Confirmed: Jan.  20 by a vote of 84-10. National Security AdviserBiden said he would appoint Jack Sullivan as his national security adviser on Nov.  23. Sullivan previously served as deputy assistant to Obama and as national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president.  He's also a former top aide to Hillary Clinton. At 43, Sullivan would be the youngest person to hold the position since the Eisenhower administration. This role does not require Senate confirmation. Special Presidential Envoy for ClimateBiden said he would name former Secretary of State John Kerry as his special presidential envoy for climate on Nov.  23.  The newly created role marks the first time the National Security Council will include an official dedicated to climate change. The Biden transition team did not immediately provide details on what responsibilities the position would entail, but Kerry comes with an extensive resume. As secretary of state, Kerry negotiated the Paris Climate Accord that was signed in 2016.  A longtime Massachusetts senator, Kerry also advocated for climate reform on Capitol Hill.  In 2004, he was the Democratic presidential nominee. This position does not require Senate confirmation. US Ambassador to the United NationsBiden announced he would nominate Linda Thomas-Greenfield for U. S.  ambassador to the United Nations on Nov.  23. Thomas-Greenfield was assistant secretary of state for Africa during the Obama administration.  She has served in the Foreign Service for more than three decades. If confirmed, she would be only the second black woman to ever hold the post. Confirmed: Feb.  23 by a vote of 78-20. Vice PresidentVice President Kamala Harris was sworn into office on Jan.  20, 2021. Before she was elected to represent California in the U. S.  Senate, she served as the state's attorney general.  She ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary race. She's the first Black woman and first South Asian American to be elected to the second highest office in the land. White House Chief of StaffBiden announced he had tapped longtime adviser Ron Klain as his White House chief of staff on Nov.  11. Klain served as Biden's chief of staff during his vice presidency.  He also led the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak. This post does not require Senate confirmation.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Nineteen Eighty-Four , often published as 1984 , is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell .  The novel is set in Airstrip One -LRB- formerly known as Great Britain -RRB- , a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war , omnipresent government surveillance , and public manipulation . The superstate and its residents are dictated to by a political regime euphemistically named English Socialism , shortened to `` Ingsoc '' in Newspeak , the government 's invented language . The superstate is under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party , a party and government that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as `` thoughtcrime '' , which is enforced by the `` Thought Police '' .   The tyranny is ostensibly overseen by Big Brother , the Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality , but who may not even exist . The Party `` seeks power entirely for its own sake . It is not interested in the good of others ; it is interested solely in power . '' The protagonist of the novel , Winston Smith , is a member of the Outer Party , who works for the Ministry of Truth -LRB- or Minitrue in Newspeak -RRB- , which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism . His job is to rewrite past newspaper articles , so that the historical record always supports the party line . The instructions that the workers receive portray the corrections as fixing misquotations and never as what they really are : forgeries and falsifications . A large part of the Ministry also actively destroys all documents that have not been edited and do not contain the revisions ; in this way , no proof exists that the government is lying . Smith is a diligent and skillful worker but secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother . The heroine of the novel , Julia , is based on Orwell 's second wife , Sonia Orwell .   As literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction , Nineteen Eighty-Four is a classic novel in content , plot and style . Many of its terms and concepts , such as Big Brother , doublethink , thoughtcrime , Newspeak , Room 101 , telescreen , 2 + 2 = 5 , and memory hole , have entered into common use since its publication in 1949 . Nineteen Eighty-Four popularised the adjective Orwellian , which describes official deception , secret surveillance , and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state . In 2005 , the novel was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 . It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels , reaching number 13 on the editor 's list , and 6 on the readers ' list .

Bahamian residents looking to evacuate the islands devastated by Hurricane Dorian will be able to ride the cruise to Florida for free, the company said in a Facebook post on Thursday. The Deerfield Beach-based cruise line is also pairing with Mission Resolve to collect money and donated supplies at the cruise\u2019s warehouse.  South Florida business leaders and nonprofits created the Bahamian Relief Consortium as part of Mission Resolve to help those affected by the hurricane. \u201cOur hearts go out to all of those impacted, and we felt it was imperative to issue a rapid response, demonstrating our support through action,\u201d Oneil Khosa, CEO of Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line, said in a press release. From CNN's Rebekah RiessUS Coast Guard crews have rescued 201 people in the Bahamas since Hurricane Dorian began, according to a news release. They continue to conduct air operations based out of Andros Island, Bahamas, with seven MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters and four MH-65 Dolphin helicopters on search and rescue missions, area assessments and providing logistical support, the release said. A great number of people are still missing in the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian, officials say, and the death toll is sure to rise. \u201cLiterally hundreds, up to thousands of people are still missing,\" Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamas' Ministry of Tourism, told Michael Holmes on \"CNN Today. \"\u201cMake no bones about it, the numbers will be far higher than\u00a023,\u201d Bahamas\u2019 Health Minister Dr.  Duane Sands said Thursday during a radio interview on Guardian Radio 96. 9 FM.  \"It is going to be significantly higher than that. \"From CNN's Rebekah RiessApproximately 243,313 customers are without power in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina as of 6:30 p. m.  ET, according to poweroutage. us. That\u2019s over 4,000 customers more than at 4:30 p. m.  ET. The bulk of the outages remain in South Carolina with 220,312 customers without power reported, 127,420 of whom are in Charleston County. 17,495 customers are without power in North Carolina, according to the website. Georgia has 5,506 customers without power.

    "evidence": "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west . The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain -LRB- which lies in the North Atlantic -RRB- in its centre and south ; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly , and the Isle of Wight .   The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law -- the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world -- developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .   England 's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there are uplands in the north -LRB- for example , the mountainous Lake District , and the Pennines -RRB- and in the southwest -LRB- for example , Dartmoor and the Cotswolds -RRB- . The capital is London , which is the largest metropolitan area in both the United Kingdom and the European Union.According to the European Statistical Agency , London is the largest Larger Urban Zone in the EU , a measure of metropolitan area which comprises a city 's urban core as well as its surrounding commuting zone . London 's municipal population is also the largest in the EU . England 's population of over 53 million comprises 84 % of the population of the United Kingdom , largely concentrated around London , the South East , and conurbations in the Midlands , the North West , the North East , and Yorkshire , which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century .   The Kingdom of England -- which after 1535 included Wales -- ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707 , when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year , resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain . In 1801 , Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . ",

    "claim": "The Chernobyl disaster is also called the Chernobyl accident.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Chernobyl disaster , also referred to as the Chernobyl accident , was a catastrophic nuclear accident . It occurred on 26 April 1986 in the No. 4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat , in what was then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union -LRB- USSR -RRB- .   During a late night safety test which simulated a station blackout power-failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off , a combination of inherent reactor design flaws , together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test , eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite fire.Although most reports on the Chernobyl accident refer to a number of graphite fires , it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned . According to the General Atomics website < http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php > : `` It is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal . Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn high-purity , nuclear-grade graphites . '' On Chernobyl , the same source states : `` Graphite played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident . The red glow observed during the Chernobyl accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at 700 \u00b0 C and not a large-scale graphite fire , as some have incorrectly assumed . '' Similarly , nuclear physicist Yevgeny Velikhov , < http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4918742.stm > noted some 2 weeks after the accident that `` Until now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist : A great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state '' That is , all the nuclear-decay heat that was generated inside the uranium fuel -LRB- heat which would normally be extracted by back-up coolant pumps , in an undamaged reactor -RRB- was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it , to glow red-hot . This is contrary to the oft cited interpretation , which is that the graphite was red-hot chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air . This fire produced considerable updrafts for about 9 days , that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere , with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase , approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion . Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to fall-out/precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe .   The Chernobyl accident dominates the Energy accidents sub-category , of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history , both in terms of cost and casualties . It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level 7 event -LRB- the maximum classification -RRB- on the International Nuclear Event Scale , the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 . The struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were , at many times falsely , perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings , ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles . During the accident , blast effects caused 2 deaths within the facility and later 29 firemen and employees died in the days-to-months afterward from acute radiation syndrome , with the potential for long-term cancers still being investigated .   The remains of the No. 4 reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus -LRB- radiation shield -RRB- by December 1986 , at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold shut-down phase ; the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station , with No. 3 continuing to produce electricity into 2000 .   The accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed reactors in the RBMK -LRB- Chernobyl No. 4 -RRB- family , of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 2013 . ",

Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century . By the 18th century , members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain , Naples , Sicily , and Parma . Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs .   The royal Bourbons originated in 1268 , when the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon married a younger son of King Louis IX . The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch , while more senior Capetians ruled France , until Henry IV became the first Bourbon king of France in 1589 . Bourbon monarchs then unified France with the small kingdom of Navarre , which Henry 's father had acquired by marriage in 1555 , and ruled until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution . Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire , the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830 . A cadet Bourbon branch , the House of Orl\u00e9ans , then ruled for 18 years -LRB- 1830 -- 1848 -RRB- , until it too was overthrown .   The Princes de Cond\u00e9 were a cadet branch of the Bourbons descended from an uncle of Henry IV , and the Princes de Conti were a cadet branch of the Cond\u00e9 . Both houses were prominent in French affairs , even during exile in the French Revolution , until their respective extinctions in 1830 and 1814 .   When the Bourbons inherited the strongest claim to the Spanish throne , the claim was passed to a cadet Bourbon prince , a grandson of Louis XIV of France , who became Philip V of Spain . Permanent separation of the French and Spanish thrones was secured when France and Spain ratified Philip 's renunciation , for himself and his descendants , of the French throne in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714 , and similar arrangements later kept the Spanish throne separate from those of the Two Sicilies and Parma . The Spanish House of Bourbon -LRB- rendered in Spanish as Borb\u00f3n -LSB- bor\u02c8\u03b2on -RSB- -RRB- has been overthrown and restored several times , reigning 1700 -- 1808 , 1813 -- 1868 , 1875 -- 1931 , and since 1975 . Bourbons ruled in Naples from 1734 -- 1806 and in Sicily from 1734 -- 1816 , and in a unified Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1816 -- 1860 . They also ruled in Parma from 1731 -- 1735 , 1748 -- 1802 and 1847 -- 1859 .   Charlotte , Grand Duchess of Luxembourg married a cadet of the Parmese line and thus her successors , who have ruled Luxembourg since her abdication in 1964 , have also been members of the House of Bourbon . Isabel , Princess Imperial of Brazil , regent for her father , Pedro II of the Empire of Brazil , married a cadet of the Orl\u00e9ans line and thus their descendants , known as the Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza , were in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne and expected to ascend its throne had the monarchy not been abolished by revolution in 1889 .   All legitimate , living members of the House of Bourbon , including its cadet branches , are direct agnatic descendants of Henry IV . , Philip V -LRB- Felipe V , Philippe , Filippo 19 December 1683 -- 9 July 1746 -RRB- was King of Spain from 1 November 1700 to 15 January 1724 , when he abdicated in favour of his son Louis , and from 6 September 1724 , when he reassumed the throne upon his son 's death , to his own death 9 July 1746 .   Before his reign , Philip occupied an exalted place in the royal family of France as a grandson of King Louis XIV . His father , Louis , the Grand Dauphin , had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700 . However , since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip 's older brother , Louis , Duke of Burgundy , could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne , King Charles II of Spain named Philip as his heir in his will . It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe , such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it . Indeed , Philip 's accession in Spain provoked the 14-year War of the Spanish Succession , which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish thrones .   Philip was the first member of the House of Bourbon to rule as king of Spain . The sum of his two reigns , 45 years and 21 days , is the longest in modern Spanish history . ",

    "evidence": "PV Sindhu\u2019s laughter filled the pause between sentences; she was ecstatic and making no effort to hide it.  The bogey of losing finals, of being the \u2018silver\u2019 girl, had been dealt with in 37 minutes.  That is the time Sindhu, 24, took to become the first Indian badminton world champion after two failed attempts, in 2017 and 2018, had seen her finish second best.  After Basel, no one will ask Sindhu why she loses finals anymore.  It was tiring answering different versions of the same poser anyway. Sindhu had lost an epic final against Japan\u2019s Nozomi Okuhara in 2017.  But on Sunday, the Japanese was like a candle in the wind and Sindhu became only the fourth player in history to win gold (2019), silver (2017 and 2018) and bronze (2013 and 2014) in women\u2019s singles at the World Championships.

Excerpts:How does it feel to reach the pinnacle of your sport? I do not have words to express (my feelings).  It is definitely a great moment for me as well as for the country.  I am feeling really happy and when the flag was flying high and the national anthem being played, it was a very proud moment.  I got goosebumps. For how long have you been nurturing this dream of being a world champion? Since I started playing.  It was the motivation to work hard.  I got bronze medals in 2013 and 2014, that was okay but the last two times (2017 and 2018) when I missed it (the gold); I went through a lot of emotion.  So, I definitely wanted this.  I was, like \u2018okay, I think it is time for me\u2019.  It is a much awaited victory. \u00a0You were in demolition mode in the semi-final and final. I don\u2019t know how. . .  but I was prepared and focused.  Of course, I was preparing for every match but this final was very important for me. This was probably the shortest final ever in terms of the number of points played. In terms of the scores, yeah, but there were long rallies.  I didn\u2019t think it would be easy.  I was prepared for everything.  It happens every time against Japanese players, a long match with long rallies.  But this time, I made sure I dominated the long rallies.  Even though I was leading and gave away a few points, I immediately recovered, got a huge lead and then closed it (game) off.  From the beginning, I was dominating but I had to be alert in defence and attack.  There was no particular strategy, every point mattered to me. You clicked a selfie with Okuhara after the match.  What did she tell you? She congratulated me and said that I played really well. Did the come-from-behind quarter-final victory against Tai Tzu Ying charge you up for the next two rounds? That match gave me a lot of confidence.  To come back and win the second and third games, it was very close.  When I was playing that match, even though I was trailing, I had hope.  Each point was very important for me and I did it. You were totally in charge in the semis and the final.  What were coaches Kim Ji-hyun and Pullela Gopichand telling you in between points? With every player there is a different strategy.  I was leading and going well but a few times you make unforced errors.  So, each point was different and they were telling me to correct whatever had gone wrong.  They were saying things like \u201cyou could have played that or you could have played this way\u201d.  That\u2019s it. Okuhara barely earned a point in the match.  Most of the points she scored were because of your errors. . . Yeah.  I did not think it was the final, I went in thinking it was just another match, the quarters or semi-finals or something.  So, I was telling myself: \u201cOkay, Sindhu, this is like any other match and you just need to give your full effort, your 100 per cent\u201d and that\u2019s how I played and won it. You were approaching the net very early between points.  Did you plan it? I hadn\u2019t planned it.  That is my strength, attacking is my strength and I used it in the right way in the final. What has been Kim\u2019s role in your growth ever since she joined the national setup earlier this year? It has been a couple of months that she has joined and it has been really helpful for me.  She had something in her mind and Gopi Sir had a few things in his, put together they helped me a lot.  I have also done a couple of sessions on how to get the best out of my skills.  Kim\u2019s views definitely helped in bringing about a lot of improvement in my game. Such as? More of skill.  I had been working on all my strokes but sometimes learning from your mistakes also helps.  So, she helped me work on my defence among other things. What did you tell your mother, who was celebrating her birthday in Hyderabad, after the match? She was so happy.  She was saying that it was the best birthday gift she could have got.  I wanted to dedicate the win to her which I did at the post-match interview.  I thought of gifting her something but now I am gifting her this gold medal.  It is only because of the efforts of my parents that I am here today. People are already talking about the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Everybody wanted this (world title).  After the Rio Olympics silver, expectations were really high.  This win makes it more special as I am the first Indian to get gold.  Tokyo 2020 is not far but right now, it\u2019s step-by-step for me.  I have to enjoy and feel this first.  I am going to celebrate a lot now.  I want to enjoy this moment. \u00a0",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said that the Delhi communal riots prima facie appeared to be a \u201cplanned conspiracy\u201d.  Responding to a discussion on the riots in Lok Sabha, Shah promised a thorough probe into the violence that claimed 52 lives and injured over 500.  Shah said the police will take stern action against the culprits, irrespective of their religion.  \u201cThe stringent action we take against people who indulged in violence will be an example for the entire country (on dealing with rioters),\u201d he said. Here\u2019s what Amit Shah said:1.  \u201cWe did not take the riots casually.  Prima facie, I believe that the riots were pre-planned.  I assured families of the riot victims that the culprits will not be spared no matter which religion, caste or political party they belong to. \u201d: Amit Shah2.  \u201cPeople should not look for religion in riots.  I want to tell everyone that 52 Indians lost their lives, 526 were injured and 142 houses were burnt.  No places of worship should be demolished.  It\u2019s wrong, irrespective of the religion. \u201d: Amit Shah3.  \u201cUS President\u2019s program was pre-scheduled, it was in my constituency, my visit there was also pre-scheduled.  The next day, when US President visited Delhi, I wasn\u2019t present at any event.  The whole time I was sitting with Police officials.  I only requested NSA to visit the area. \u201d: Amit Shah 4.  \u201cI did not go there (to the spot of riots) myself as I didn\u2019t want the police to divert resources towards my security arrangements.  I assure the House that the Delhi Police will hold a thorough investigation into this incident. \u201d: Amit Shah5.  \u201cAll those who caused the violence will not be able to escape the law.  We are ensuring that no action is taken against any innocent person.  49 cases of Arms Act have been registered & 153 arms have been recovered.  Over 650 meeting of peace committee have taken place since February 25. \u201d: Amit ShahAlso read: Conspiracy in Delhi communal riots being probed, says Amit Shah in Lok Sabha6.  \u201cThe spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a conspiracy.  We have register a case of conspiracy to probe this angle.  Three people have been arrested for financing the violence in North East Delhi. \u201d: Amit Shah7.  \u201cAround 60 social media accounts were created on 22nd February and were closed down on 26th Feb.  Police will find those behind them.  Social media was used to incite hate. \u201d: Amit Shah8.  \u201cControlling and putting a full stop to riots in just 36 hours in the dense area as it was a commendable job performed by Delhi Police.  I assure the people of India that right investigation will be done and stern actions will be taken against the rioters\u201d: Amit Shah9.  \u201cI want to put it on record that there has not been a single incident of communal violence in Delhi after 11 pm of 25th February 2020. \u201d: Amit Shah10.  \u201cQuestions have been asked about what the Delhi Police was doing.  Police were on the ground then, police will also probe and submit a report in coming days.  I would like to praise the Delhi Police for not allowing the riots to spread to other areas. \u201d: Amit Shah(With inputs from ANI)",

The feminine version is Roberta . The Italian , Portuguese , and Spanish form is Roberto .   Similar to the name Richard , `` Robert '' is also a common name in many Germanic languages , including English , German , Dutch , Norwegian , Swedish , Danish , and Icelandic . It can be used as a French , Irish , Scottish , Finnish , and Estonian name as well . , Henry II -LRB- 5 March 1133 -- 6 July 1189 -RRB- , also known as Henry Curtmantle -LRB- Court-manteau -RRB- , Henry FitzEmpress or Henry Plantagenet , ruled as Count of Anjou , Count of Maine , Duke of Normandy , Duke of Aquitaine , Count of Nantes , King of England -LRB- 1154 -- 89 -RRB- and Lord of Ireland ; at various times , he also controlled Wales , Scotland and Brittany . Henry was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda , daughter of Henry I of England . He became actively involved by the age of 14 in his mother 's efforts to claim the throne of England , then occupied by Stephen of Blois , and was made Duke of Normandy at 17 . He inherited Anjou in 1151 and shortly afterwards married Eleanor of Aquitaine , whose marriage to Louis VII of France had recently been annulled . Stephen agreed to a peace treaty after Henry 's military expedition to England in 1153 : Henry inherited the kingdom on Stephen 's death a year later .   Henry was an energetic and sometimes ruthless ruler , driven by a desire to restore the lands and privileges of his royal grandfather , Henry I . During the early years of his reign the younger Henry restored the royal administration in England , re-established hegemony over Wales and gained full control over his lands in Anjou , Maine and Touraine . Henry 's desire to reform the relationship with the Church led to conflict with his former friend Thomas Becket , the Archbishop of Canterbury . This controversy lasted for much of the 1160s and resulted in Becket 's murder in 1170 . Henry soon came into conflict with Louis VII and the two rulers fought what has been termed a `` cold war '' over several decades . Henry expanded his empire , often at Louis ' expense , taking Brittany and pushing east into central France and south into Toulouse ; despite numerous peace conferences and treaties , no lasting agreement was reached . By 1172 , he controlled England , large parts of Wales , the eastern half of Ireland and the western half of France , an area that would later come to be called the Angevin Empire .   Henry and Eleanor had eight children . As they grew up , tensions over the future inheritance of the empire began to emerge , encouraged by Louis and his son King Philip II . In 1173 Henry 's heir apparent , `` Young Henry '' , rebelled in protest ; he was joined by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey and by their mother , Eleanor . France , Scotland , Flanders , and Boulogne allied themselves with the rebels . The Great Revolt was only defeated by Henry 's vigorous military action and talented local commanders , many of them `` new men '' appointed for their loyalty and administrative skills . Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted again in 1183 , resulting in Young Henry 's death . The Norman invasion of Ireland provided lands for his youngest son John , but Henry struggled to find ways to satisfy all his sons ' desires for land and immediate power . Philip successfully played on Richard 's fears that Henry would make John king , and a final rebellion broke out in 1189 . Decisively defeated by Philip and Richard and suffering from a bleeding ulcer , Henry retreated to Chinon in Anjou , where he died .   Henry 's empire quickly collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John . Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule , however , had long-term consequences . Henry 's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law , while his intervention in Brittany , Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems . Historical interpretations of Henry 's reign have changed considerably over time . In the 18th century , scholars argued that Henry was a driving force in the creation of a genuinely English monarchy and , ultimately , a unified Britain . During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire , historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry 's own empire , but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket . Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry , challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign . , Empress Matilda -LRB- c. 7 February 110210 September 1167 -RRB- , also known as the Empress Maude , was the claimant to the English throne during the civil war known as the Anarchy . The daughter of King Henry I of England , she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future Holy Roman Emperor Henry V . She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116 , was controversially crowned in St. Peter 's Basilica , and acted as the imperial regent in Italy . Matilda and Henry had no children , and when Henry died in 1125 , the crown was claimed by Lothair II , one of his political enemies .   Meanwhile , Matilda 's younger brother , William Adelin , died in the White Ship disaster of 1120 , leaving England facing a potential succession crisis . On Henry V 's death , Matilda was recalled to Normandy by her father , who arranged for her to marry Geoffrey of Anjou to form an alliance to protect his southern borders . Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir , making his court swear an oath of loyalty to her and her successors , but the decision was not popular in the Anglo-Norman court . Henry died in 1135 but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the Norman barons and were unable to pursue their claims . The throne was instead taken by Matilda 's cousin Stephen of Blois , who enjoyed the backing of the English Church . Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime , but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom .   In 1139 Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force , supported by her half-brother , Robert of Gloucester , and her uncle , King David I of Scotland , while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy . Matilda 's forces captured Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141 , but the Empress 's attempt to be crowned at Westminster collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds . As a result of this retreat , Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England , and was instead titled the Lady of the English . Robert was captured following the Rout of Winchester in 1141 , and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen . Matilda became trapped in Oxford Castle by Stephen 's forces that winter , and was forced to escape across the frozen River Isis at night to avoid capture . The war degenerated into a stalemate , with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England , and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands . Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local , independent barons .   Matilda returned to Normandy , now in the hands of her husband , in 1148 , leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England ; he eventually succeeded to the throne as Henry II in 1154 . She settled her court near Rouen and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy , acting on Henry 's behalf when necessary . Particularly in the early years of her son 's reign , she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the Becket controversy . She worked extensively with the Church , founding Cistercian monasteries , and was known for her piety . She was buried under the high altar at Bec Abbey after her death in 1167 . , Stephen or Steven -LRB- both -LSB- \u02c8sti\u02d0v\u0259n -RSB- -RRB- is a first name derived from the Greek first name \u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 -LRB- St\u00e9phanos -RRB- , in turn from the Greek word '' \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 '' , meaning `` wreath , crown , honour , reward '' , literally `` that which surrounds or encompasses '' . In ancient Greece , a wreath was given to the winner of a contest -LRB- from which the crown , symbol of rulers derived -RRB- . The use of the noun was first recorded in Homer 's Iliad . The name is significant to Christians , since it belonged to an early saint , according to the Book of Acts in the New Testament , the Greek-speaking St\u00e9phanos , rendered as `` Stephen '' in English translations , was a deacon who was stoned to death and is regarded as the first martyr , in Greek `` protomartyr '' , of the Christian Church .   Related names include Stephan -LSB- \u02c8st\u025bf\u0259n -RSB- , Stefan -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8\u0283te\u02d0fan -RSB- -RRB- , and Esteban -LRB- -LSB- es\u02c8te\u03b2an -RSB- -RRB- . The name has many variants , which include Stevan , Stefan and Stevon . Steve is the common short form , while various diminutives such as Stevie and Ste are also used . The female version of the name is Stephanie . Many family names are derived from Stephen : the most common are Stephens/Stevens and Stephenson/Stevenson -LRB- others include Stephen , Stephan , Staphan , Stefan , Stevin and Stever -RRB- .   In the United Kingdom , it peaked during the 1950s and 1960s as one of the top ten male first names -LRB- ranking third in 1954 -RRB- but had fallen to twentieth by 1984 and had fallen out of the top one hundred by 2002 . The name was ranked 201 in the United States in 2009 , according to the Social Security Administration . The name reached its peak popularity in 1951 but remained very common through the mid-1990s , when popularity started to decrease in the United States . , The White Ship -LRB- Candida nauis , la Blanche-Nef -RRB- was a vessel that sank in the English Channel near the Normandy coast off Barfleur , on 25 November 1120 . Only one of those aboard survived . Those who drowned included William Adelin , the only legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England , his half-sister Matilda , and his half-brother Richard . William Adelin 's death led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war in England known as the Anarchy . ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Pence and Harris offered opposing realities of the response to COVID-19.  Vice presidential debate key momentsThe vice presidential candidates for president faced off on Wednesday for their first and only debate, giving Americans a much more substantive look at the ticket \u2014 though often not the substance that they were prompted for. The candidates repeatedly dodged the questions from moderator Susan Page, remaining focused on one thing: correcting the wrongs of last week\u2019s debate. For Vice President Mike Pence, the goal was to tout the administration\u2019s economic success pre-pandemic and erase the disheveled, at times disrespectful debate from last week, spearheaded by President Donald Trump\u2019s constant interruptions. The president, of course, watched in isolation from the White House, after contracting coronavirus himself after flouting countless Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. For Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, the goal was to defend presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s record and hammer the administration\u2019s response to coronavirus. The candidates took the stage separated by 12 feet and plexiglass barriers, demanded by Harris because of the 34 White House staffers and other contacts in the administration\u2019s orbit.  Though Pence tested negative for coronavirus on Wednesday ahead of the debate, he is still within the potential incubation period for the virus. The debate took place at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Here are the key takeaways. A discussion on coronavirus, laden with empathyIn stark contrast to Trump\u2019s performance during the debate last week \u2014 almost a lifetime of news cycles ago \u2014 Pence repeatedly offered something the president, who describes himself as a fighter, rarely focuses on: empathy. In defending the federal response to coronavirus, Pence consistently offered condolences to Americans who have suffered before launching into his response. \u201cYou know, there's not a day gone by that I haven't thought of every American family that\u2019s lost a loved one.  And I want all of you to know that you\u2019ll always be in our hearts and in our prayers,\u201d Pence said. \u201cOne life lost is too many, Susan,\u201d Pence said later, before flipping Harris\u2019 criticism of the White House\u2019s response on its head by saying it was dismissive of the sacrifice Americans have made. \u201cWhen you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made,\u201d he said. But Harris was quick to point out the missteps the Trump administration has made in controlling the pandemic, which has killed over 211,000 Americans over the last eight months, including audio released of Trump acknowledging that the disease was airborne in January, long before that critical information was disclosed to the public. \u201cWhatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked.  When you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss,\u201d Harris said. She was blunt in describing the tragedy, not mincing any words. \u201cThe American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\u201d Harris said.  \u201cThey knew what was happening and they didn\u2019t tell you \u2026 They knew and they covered it up. \u201dShe added that her and Biden\u2019s plan includes a national strategy for contact tracing, testing, administration of the vaccine, \u201cand making sure that it will be free for all. \u201dHarris expresses skepticism over vaccine while Pence calls on her to stop politicizing the virusHarris reiterated her concern about the safety and validity of a vaccine spearheaded by the Trump administration, stating strongly that she won\u2019t get any vaccine pushed by Trump, and will only get a vaccine backed by medical professionals \u2014 a statement that leaves room for Harris to reject a vaccine that arrives before the Election, although that\u2019s an unlikely scenario. \"If the public health professionals \u2014 if Dr.  Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,\" Harris said.  \"But if Donald Trump tells us I should take it \u2014 that we should take it, I'm not taking it. \"Harris's concerns come on the heels of fears that the Trump administration was fast-tracking a vaccine to help his chances in reelection efforts, though the administration approved FDA guidelines on Wednesday that allow for a more robust trial period. Pence called on Harris to \"stop politicizing the virus,\" saying she was playing politics with American lives. \"So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if a vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable,\" Pence said.  \"And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with peoples' lives.  The reality is, that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year. \"Despite the skepticism coming from Harris on the vaccine, a CNN poll recently found that Republicans are more skeptical of the coronavirus vaccine than Democrats.  If a coronavirus vaccine were widely available at a low cost, 60% of Democrats say they would receive the vaccine, well 35% say they wouldn't.  In contrast, 41% of Republicans say they would get the vaccine, while 55% say that they wouldn't. Notably milder tone stands in contrast to last weekThe style of the debate this week resembled just what it was billed as: a vice presidential debate. There was not a remarkably high bar for civility after the last debate, but it was exceeded on all sides.  It wasn\u2019t without interruptions, dodges, disagreements and one-liners, but moderator Susan Page kept the candidates on track, cracking down on time limits to ensure each candidate got 2 minutes, uninterrupted. The debate was mostly focused on records and absent of personal attacks. Instead, Pence seemed to make a deliberate decision to take a completely different approach than Trump, who aggressively interrupted over 70 times in 90 minutes, often with insults. \u201cSenator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you,\u201d Pence began the debate by saying.  Later, he congratulated her on \u201cthe historic nature\u201d of her nomination as the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party. He also turned to Harris and thanked her for both her and Biden\u2019s \u201cexpressions of genuine concern\u201d when the president was diagnosed with coronavirus. When disagreeing, Pence twice used the line, \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your own opinion,\u201d before adding \u201cyou\u2019re not entitled to your own facts. \u201dBut Harris clearly wasn\u2019t buying Pence\u2019s politeness, politically-motivated or not. \u201cMr.  Vice President, I\u2019m speaking,\u201d she said whenever he interrupted, words that carried the heavy weight of Trump\u2019s notoriously hard-to-watch performance last week. \u201cIf you don't mind letting me finish, we can have a conversation,\u201d she said another time.  The next time Pence interrupted, Harris shot him a single glance.  Pence stopped speaking, and looked away. On the Supreme Court, still no clear answer from Harris on court-packingPence held Harris\u2019 feet to the fire over the question of court-packing, a move that would allow Biden and Harris, if they win the presidency and Democrats take control of the Senate, to add more members to the Supreme Court and adjust for the conservative majority that Judge Amy Coney Barrett would bring. Multiple times, Harris refused to heed to Pence\u2019s demands for her to give a straight answer.  Court-packing, which is heralded by progressives, is a more touchy subject amongst moderate Democrats \u2014 creating a political tightrope both Biden and Harris continue to walk. \u201cNow you\u2019ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question,\u201d he continued.  \u201cSo I think the American people would really like to know, if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the supreme court to get your way? \u201dHarris offered a non-answer, instead, making a dig at the judges Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have nominated to federal courts across the country. \u201cAnd do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black? \u201d Harris said.  \u201cThis is what they\u2019ve been doing.  You want to talk about packing a court?  Let's have that discussion. \u201dPence called Harris out for her lack of an answer. \u201cThe American people deserve a straight answer.  And if you have not figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. \u201dPence deflects on climate change, a peaceful transition of power and the future of Roe V.  WadeVice President Pence spent much of his time either deflecting questions to hammer Harris, or answering previous questions posed to him by Page.  When asked about Roe V.  Wade, he brought up the Trump administration\u2019s killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.  On China, he pivoted to NAFTA. And on the question of climate change, Pence pivoted to Joe Biden's tax plan. \"As I said, Susan, the climate is changing.  We'll follow the science.  But, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American,\" he said.  \"Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one, he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts.  Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. \"Page posed to Pence the possibility of Roe V.  Wade being overturned should conservatives gain a larger majority in the courts \u2014 and what he would like to see happen in his home state of Indiana if that were the case. \"Well, thank you for the question, but I will use a little bit of my time to respond to the very important issue before.  The American people deserve to know, Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members,\" he said. He also danced around the question about the transparency of presidential health. \"Is this information voters deserve to know? \" Page asked Pence of presidential health records.   \"Vice President Pence, would you like to go first? \"\"Susan, thank you.  And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern and for the president,\" he said, not offering a response relevant to the question. On the consequential question of a peaceful transition of power out of the White House, which the president has consistently refused to pledge should he lose in November, Pence, too, dodged, instead attacking Democrats for impeaching the president. \"When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election.  I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years overturning the last election.  It's amazing,\" Pence said.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "`` Bohemian Rhapsody '' is a song by the British rock band Queen . It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band 's 1975 album A Night at the Opera . It is a six-minute suite , consisting of several sections without a chorus : an intro , a ballad segment , an operatic passage , a hard rock part and a reflective coda . The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre . It was reportedly the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release , though the exact cost of production can not be determined .   When it was released as a single , `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' became a commercial success , staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976 . It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released , eventually becoming the UK 's third-best-selling single of all time . It is also the only song to be Christmas number one twice by the same artist . It topped the charts in several other markets as well , including Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Ireland and The Netherlands , later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time . In the United States the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976 . It returned to the chart at number two in 1992 following Freddie Mercury 's death in 1991 , as well as its appearance in the film Wayne 's World , which revived its American popularity .   Although critical reaction was initially mixed , `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' remains one of Queen 's most popular songs and is frequently placed on modern lists of the greatest songs of all time . The single was accompanied by a promotional video , which many scholars consider ground-breaking . Rolling Stone magazine states : `` Its influence can not be overstated , practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air . '' In 2004 , `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . In 2012 , the song topped the list on an ITV nationwide poll in the UK to find `` The Nation 's Favourite Number One '' over 60 years of music . ",

Hoffman struggled with drug addiction as a young adult , and relapsed in 2013 after many years of sobriety . In February 2014 , he was found dead with a syringe of heroin still in his arm , but the official cause of death was combined drug intoxication -- an unexpected event that was widely lamented in the film and theater industries . Remembered for his fearlessness in playing reprehensible characters , and for bringing depth and humanity to such roles , Hoffman was described in his New York Times obituary as `` perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation '' .

    "claim": "A viral video shows a cake bar that is sold in the U.S. with two \"paralysis tablets\" added to it by its Turkish manufacturers.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "In November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the authenticity of a video that went viral in late October and early November, and that appeared to show \u201cparalysis\u201d pills hidden inside a Turkish-made snack bar. One widely shared iteration of the video was accompanied by the following caption: \u201cALERT! These packets of snack are dangerous! Made in Turkey and exported to USA & Israel \u2026 inside each cake are tablets that cause paralysis!!! DO NOT EAT, DO NOT BUY! PLZ FWD\u2026\u201d  In Mexico, the video was shared largely on WhatsApp, along with a message that specifically warned that the \u201ctablets\u201d cause \u201cpermanent cerebral palsy.\u201d In reality, it\u2019s unclear exactly what the footage showed or at what stage or by whom the \u201ctablets\u201d were added to the bar in question. However, no evidence exists to indicate that the objects were inserted by the snack\u2019s Turkish manufacturer, nor that such \u201ctablets\u201d induced paralysis. (Medically, it is not possible for a drug to induce cerebral palsy in an otherwise healthy child or adult, so this specific claim, shared widely in Mexico, was false.) Furthermore, the Luppo coconut cream bars are sold only in Iraq, and not in the U.S. or Israel, as the viral social media warning falsely claimed. Documents provided to Snopes by the company that makes the snack show that its production processes, contamination safeguards, and safety certifications mean it is effectively impossible for a foreign object such as the \u201ctablets\u201d shown in the viral footage to be inserted at source. As a result, we are satisfied to conclude that the video is either an orchestrated effort to mislead millions of viewers about the contents of the snack bar, or it shows an isolated instance where an individual has, for whatever reason, contaminated a Luppo bar on a local level. It might show objects that have been inserted into a coconut cream bar, but those objects were not inserted by the manufacturer and do not pose a threat to consumers in various countries, including the United States. The Turkish fact-checking website Teyit conducted a thorough investigation of the viral footage, tracing its spread to an original video posted to YouTube on Oct. 28.  Teyit came to the conclusion that the footage was most likely filmed in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, because the language heard towards the end of the clip is Sorani, a Kurdish language, and because the brand of chicken seen in the refrigerator in the background (\u201cAs Pili\u00e7\u201d) is widely sold in that region. A spokesperson for S\u00f6len, the Turkish company that makes the Luppo coconut cream bar, confirmed that that particular product is only sold in Iraq. This disproves the claim, contained in the widely shared warning message, that the snack is \u201cMade in Turkey and exported to USA & Israel.\u201d It is made in Turkey, but it is only sold in Iraq. Journalists based in the region told Teyit that the contamination of the coconut cream bar shown in the video could plausibly be part of a politically motivated effort to discredit popular Turkish brands, as part of ongoing Kurdish-Turkish tensions. Teyit correctly noted that the surface of the bar shown in the video shows signs of having been punctured. Although not definitive evidence, this would be consistent with someone opening a bar, inserting the \u201ctablets\u201d by pushing them into the interior of the cake, and then repackaging the bar. For its part, S\u00f6len emphatically rejected the authenticity of the viral video. In a detailed and lengthy email statement sent to Snopes, a spokesperson for the company called the footage \u201cdelusive, groundless and false\u201d and said it was \u201cproduced entirely with the object of defamation.\u201d The spokesperson said the company was already seeking to take legal action against those responsible. S\u00f6len provided multiple documents showing the safety certifications of the plants where S\u00f6len products, including the Luppo coconut cream bar, are manufactured. Those inspections were conducted by the Swiss company SGS. Crucially, the spokesperson also pointed out that among the several filtration systems used in producing and processing the batter, cream, chocolate and filling components of various Luppo bars was one that blocks any particle greater than 700 microns (0.7 millimeters) in height or width. The \u201ctablets\u201d shown in the viral video footage are clearly larger than those dimensions, and so could not have been added to the cake bar while it was being made. The spokesperson also noted that the production process is entirely automated, meaning the components of each snack are \u201cuntouched by human hands\u201d until each product is already in its packaging. It\u2019s unclear exactly what objects the viral video shows embedded in the Luppo coconut cream bar or how they got there. It\u2019s possible they could have been inserted by the person who filmed the video, in a deliberate effort to mislead viewers, potentially as part of a politically motivated campaign of smearing Turkish brands. They could also have been inserted by someone else on a local level, before the individual who made the video inadvertently created the scare by sharing what was found, in a sincere attempt to warn others. However, no evidence exists to indicate that the objects were tablets, or that they could induce paralysis. Furthermore, Luppo coconut cream bars are not sold anywhere other than Iraq, contrary to viral claims they were sold in the U.S. and Israel. Finally, the production processes, safety certifications, and contamination safeguards in place at factories that manufacture the Luppo bars mean it is effectively impossible for any object such as the \u201ctablets\u201d shown in the video to be added to bar at source.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "With a diameter of up to 1\u00a0m, and a height reaching 8.8\u00a0m, \"Prototaxites\" fossils are remnants of by far the largest organism discovered from the period of its existence. Viewed from afar, the fossils take the form of tree-trunks, spreading slightly near their base in a fashion that suggests a connection to unpreserved root-like structures. Infilled casts which may represent the spaces formerly occupied by \"roots\" of \"Prototaxites\" are common in early Devonian strata. Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grew sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the preserved \"trunks\" represent the fruiting body, or \"sporophore\", of a fungus, which would have been fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed filaments (\"hyphae\"). On a microscopic scale, the fossils consist of narrow tube-like structures, which weave around one another. These come in two types: skeletal \"tubes\", 20\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm across, have thick (2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm) walls and are undivided for their length, and generative \"filaments\", which are thinner (5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) and branch frequently; these mesh together to form the organism's matrix. These thinner filaments are septate\u2014that is to say, they bear internal walls. These septa are perforate\u2014i.e. they contain a pore, a trait only present in the modern red algae and fungi.The basidiocarps, or fruit bodies, of immature \"Gomphus clavatus\" are club-shaped and have one cap or pileus, but later spread out and have a so-called \"merismatoid\" appearance\u2014several vase-shaped caps rising from a common stem. The fruit body is up to wide and tall, fan-shaped with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown hyphae (microscopic filaments) that form small, distinct patches towards the margin, but combine to form a continuous felt-like fine-haired area, or tomentum, over the center of the cap. The color of the upper cap surface is orange-brown to violet, but fades to a lighter brown with age. The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged. The lower spore-bearing surface\u2014the hymenium\u2014is wrinkled, often with folds and pits, and violet to brown in color. The solid stem, which is continuous with the cap, is wide, tall, and covered with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base. It is often compound, with several fruit bodies arising from the basal portion. Fruit bodies may bruise reddish-brown where handled. The flesh can be whitish-pink to lilac or cinnamon-buff. Thick under the center of the cap, it thins out towards the margins. It can be crunchy, though it is softer than that of the chanterelle. The taste and odor are mild. The spore print is yellow to orange-yellow.",

    "claim": "The New York Times stated, as fact, that Hillary Clinton and George Soros had been responsible for paying a woman to make false allegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a widely shared article that claimed The New York Times had \u201caffirmed\u201d that billionaire philanthropist George Soros and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had paid a woman to accuse U.S. President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her. On Nov. 29, the right-leaning website TheRedPilledNews published an article with the headline \u201cThe New York Times Affirms: \u2018Soros and Clinton Paid Woman to Accuse Trump of Sexual Attack.\u201d The article reported that: The Times article referred to in the post was published on Dec. 31, 2017. It outlined the efforts of actors from both major parties to capitalize upon and amplify allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of politicians, as well as providing support and financial backing to their accusers. The Times piece noted the concerns expressed by some activists for sexual assault survivors that this involvement of money in the broader #MeToo movement could muddy the waters and create the misperception that some women, genuine survivors of sexual misconduct, were being paid to fabricate false allegations against male politicians. Contrary to TheRedPilledNews\u2019 claim, the article did not aver that \u201cSoros and Clinton Paid Woman to Accuse Trump of Sexual Attack.\u201d Nor did the Times\u2019 article state that anyone, whether associated with Soros or Clinton or otherwise, had paid anyone in order to induce them to accuse Trump of anything. Therefore, TheRedPilledNews\u2019 claim was false. Rather, the Times article examined the phenomenon of fundraising and donations for women who have accused, or were about to accuse, politicians and other public figures of sexual misconduct. As one example, the piece outlined the actions of Lisa Bloom, an attorney best known for representing women who have accused high-profile men of sexual wrongdoing (but who also briefly acted as an adviser to the movie producer Harvey Weinstein, while he was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and sexual assault). The article reported that: The Times article described practices that some observers might find ethically questionable, and some readers might well be uncomfortable with any injection whatsoever of partisan politics or fundraising into an allegation of sexual misconduct. However, the article did not state as fact any allegation that Bloom or other lawyers had taken part in an operation that involved paying women in order to induce them to make false allegations, as opposed to accepting donations to defray the costs involved in vetting would-be accusers, or securing their safety once they go public. The article added: \u201c[Bloom] said that she did not receive any legal fees for the work, and that she did not communicate with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign \u2018on any of this.\u2019 She said she represented only clients whose stories she had corroborated, and disputed the premise that she offered money to coax clients to come forward.\u201d More specific allegations about Bloom\u2019s actions came in a December 2017 article by John Solomon, published by the political news website The Hill. Those allegations can be found here. In November 2019, The Hill announced it had begun a review of several of Solomon\u2019s articles, after witnesses at Congressional hearings into the impeachment of Trump described the stories as being of questionable veracity. Solomon\u2019s association with The Hill ended earlier in 2019. Neither Solomon\u2019s story nor the Times\u2019 article claimed Clinton had been involved in any payment designed to induce anyone to make any allegation, false or otherwise, against anyone, including Trump. Neither article even mentioned Soros. TheRedPilledNews.com.\u00a0 \u201cThe New York Times Affirms: \u2018Soros & Clinton Paid Woman to Accuse Trump of Sexual Attack.\u201d\n\u00a0 29 November 2019.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Kingdom of Nepal , also known as the Kingdom of Gorkha , was a kingdom formed in 1768 by the unification of Nepal . Founded by King Prithvi Narayan Shah , a Gorkhali monarch of Rajput origin , it existed for 240 years until the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008 . During this period , Nepal was formally under the rule of the Shah dynasty , which exercised varying degrees of power during the kingdom 's existence .   After invasion of Tibet and plundering of Digarcha by Nepali forces under Prince Regent Bahadur Shah in the 1792 , the Dalai Lama and Chinese Ambans reported to Chinese administration for military support . The Chinese and Tibetan forces under Fu Kang An attacked Nepal but went for negotiation after failure at Nuwakot . During the early-nineteenth century , however , the expansion of the East India Company 's rule in India led to the Anglo-Nepalese War -LRB- 1814 -- 1816 -RRB- , which resulted in Nepal 's defeat . Under the Sugauli Treaty , the kingdom retained its independence , but in exchange for territorial concessions making Mechi River to Mahakali River its boundary under Nepalese rule , sometimes known as `` Greater Nepal '' . Forces sent by Jung Bahadur Rana defeated the Tibetan forces on 1855 to force the Tibetan side to sign treaty favouring Nepal . Political instability following the war resulted in the ascendancy of the Rana dynasty of Khas Chhetri Rajput origin , which made the office of Prime Ministers of Nepal hereditary in their family for the next century , from 1843 to 1951 . Beginning with Jung Bahadur , the first Rana ruler , the Rana dynasty reduced the Shah monarch to a figurehead role . Rana rule was marked by tyranny , debauchery , economic exploitation and religious persecution .   In July 1950 , the newly independent republic of India signed a friendship treaty in which both nations agreed to respect the other 's sovereignty . In November of the same year , India played an important role in supporting King Tribhuhvan , whom the Rana leader Mohan Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana had attempted to depose and replace with his infant grandson King Gyanendra . With Indian support for a new government consisting largely of the Nepali Congress , King Tribhuvan ended the rule of the Rana dynasty in 1951 .   Unsuccessful attempts were made to implement reforms and a constitution during the 1960s and 1970s . An economic crisis at the end of the 1980s led to a popular movement which brought about parliamentary elections and the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in 1990 . The 1990s saw the beginning of the Nepalese Civil War -LRB- 1996 -- 2006 -RRB- , a conflict between government forces and the insurgent forces of the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Maoist -RRB- . The situation for the Nepalese monarchy was further destabilised by the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre , in which Crown Prince Dipendra reportedly shot and killed ten people , including his father King Birendra , and was himself mortally wounded by what was allegedly a self-inflicted gunshot .   As a result of the massacre , King Gyanendra returned to the throne . His imposition of direct rule in 2005 provoked a protest movement unifying the Maoist insurgency and pro-democracy activists . He was eventually forced to restore Nepal 's House of Representatives , which in 2007 adopted an interim constitution greatly restricting the powers of the Nepalese monarchy . Following an election held the next year , the Nepalese Constituent Assembly formally abolished the kingdom in its first session on 28 May 2008 , declaring the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal in its place .   Until the abolition of the monarchy , Nepal was the world 's only country to have Hinduism as its state religion ; the country is now formally a secular state . , fi     Nepal -LRB- -LSB- Nep\u0101lhelp = no -RSB- -RCB- -RCB- -LSB- ne\u02c8pal -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal , is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia . Nepal is divided into 7 provinces and 75 districts and 744 local units including 4 metropolises , 13 sub-metropolises , 246 municipal councils and 481 villages . It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area . Bordering China in the north and India in the south , east , and west , it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state . Nepal does not border Bangladesh , which is located within only 27 km -LRB- 17 mi -RRB- of its southeastern tip . Neither does it border Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the nation 's capital and largest city . It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language .   The territory of Nepal has a recorded history since the Neolithic age . The name `` Nepal '' is first recorded in texts from the Vedic Age , the era which founded Hinduism , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal became known as Nepal proper because of its complex urban civilisation . It was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders . The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture . By the 18th century , the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal . The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire , under its Rana dynasty of premiers . The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and Colonial India . In the 20th century , Nepal ended its isolation and forged strong ties with regional powers . Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 , but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs in 1960 and 2005 . The Nepalese Civil War resulted in the proclamation of a republic in 2008 , ending the reign of the world 's last Hindu monarchy .   Modern Nepal is a federal secular parliamentary republic . It has seven states . Nepal is a developing nation , ranking 144th on the Human Development Index -LRB- HDI -RRB- in 2016 . The country struggles with the transition from a monarchy to a republic . It also suffers from high levels of hunger and poverty . Despite these challenges , Nepal is making steady progress , with the government declaring its commitment to elevate the nation from least developed country status by 2022 . Nepal also has a vast potential to generate hydropower for export .   Nepal 's foreign relations expanded after the Anglo-Nepal Treaty of 1923 , which was recognised by the League of Nations . After a Soviet veto in 1949 , Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 . Friendship treaties were signed with the Dominion of India in 1950 and the People 's Republic of China in 1960 . Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation -LRB- SAARC -RRB- , of which it is a founding member . Nepal is also a member of the Non Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative . The military of Nepal is the fifth largest in South Asia and is notable for its Gurkha history , particularly during the world wars , and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations .

Walker was the guardian of young Thomas Jefferson after Jefferson's father's death. Daniel Boone passed through Cumberland Gap in 1775 and must have also seen the cave's entrance. Boone and his contemporary, an African American, Monk Estill, are the first on record to have made gunpowder in Kentucky. Saltpeter mining at Cumberland Gap may well have begun before 1800. An adjacent cave, sometimes referred to as Soldiers Cave, was explored by Confederate and Union soldiers as well as Gap Cave. Local historians say armies used Soldiers cave as a military hospital and for storage. Names and dates inscribed along the cavern walls document military presence. There is evidence that the greater part of the Gap Cave system was used to mine for Saltpeter in the 1800s and became known as the Saltpeter Cave.Duty at Camp Dick Robinson, Ky., until January 1862.

    "claim": "William McKinley served as president.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "William McKinley Jr. -LRB- January 29 , 1843 -- September 14 , 1901 -RRB- was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 25th President of the United States from March 4 , 1897 until his assassination in September 1901 , six months into his second term . McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish -- American War , raised protective tariffs to promote American industry , and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals .   McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War , and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier , beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major . After the war , he settled in Canton , Ohio , where he practiced law and married Ida Saxton . In 1876 , he was elected to Congress , where he became the Republican Party 's expert on the protective tariff , which he promised would bring prosperity . His 1890 McKinley Tariff was highly controversial ; which together with a Democratic redistricting aimed at gerrymandering him out of office , led to his defeat in the Democratic landslide of 1890 . He was elected Ohio 's governor in 1891 and 1893 , steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests . With the aid of his close adviser Mark Hanna , he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896 , amid a deep economic depression . He defeated his Democratic rival , William Jennings Bryan , after a front-porch campaign in which he advocated `` sound money '' -LRB- the gold standard unless altered by international agreement -RRB- and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity .   Rapid economic growth marked McKinley 's presidency . He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition , and in 1900 , he secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act . McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict , but when negotiation failed , he led the nation into the Spanish -- American War of 1898 ; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive . As part of the peace settlement , Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines ; Cuba was promised independence , but at that time remained under the control of the U.S. Army . The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory .   Historians regard McKinley 's 1896 victory as a realigning election , in which the political stalemate of the post -- Civil War era gave way to the Republican-dominated Fourth Party System , which began with the Progressive Era . McKinley defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election , in a campaign focused on imperialism , protectionism , and free silver . However , his legacy was quickly cut short when he was shot on September 6 , 1901 by Leon Czolgosz , a second-generation Polish-American with anarchist leanings ; McKinley died eight days later , and was succeeded by his Vice President Theodore Roosevelt . As an innovator of American interventionism and pro-business sentiment , McKinley 's presidency is generally considered above average , though his universally positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt .

The European , or metropolitan , area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans . France spans 643801 km2 and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017 . It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Other major urban centres include Marseille , Lyon , Lille , Nice , Toulouse and Bordeaux .   During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . The area was annexed in 51 BC by Rome , which held Gaul until 486 , when the Germanic Franks conquered the region and formed the Kingdom of France . France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , with its victory in the Hundred Years ' War -LRB- 1337 to 1453 -RRB- strengthening state-building and political centralisation . During the Renaissance , French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established , which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world . The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants -LRB- Huguenots -RRB- . France became Europe 's dominant cultural , political , and military power under Louis XIV . In the late 18th century , the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy , established one of modern history 's earliest republics , and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , which expresses the nation 's ideals to this day .   In the 19th century Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire , whose subsequent Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of continental Europe . Following the collapse of the Empire , France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 . France was a major participant in the First World War , from which it emerged victorious , and was one of the Allied Powers in the Second World War , but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940 . Following liberation in 1944 , a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War . The Fifth Republic , led by Charles de Gaulle , was formed in 1958 and remains to this day . Algeria and nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s and typically retained close economic and military connections with France .   France has long been a global centre of art , science , and philosophy . It hosts Europe 's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually , the most of any country in the world . France is a developed country with the world 's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity . In terms of aggregate household wealth , it ranks fourth in the world . France performs well in international rankings of education , health care , life expectancy , and human development . France remains a great power in the world , being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and an official nuclear-weapon state . It is a leading member state of the European Union and the Eurozone . It is also a member of the Group of 7 , North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- , the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , and La Francophonie .

BOOM found that in the original clip Modi was actually referring to the Congress party and attacking them stating that this has always been their formula to stay in power.  In the viral clip, PM Modi can be heard saying - 'gareeb ko sirf sapne dikhao, jhoot bolo, use aapas mein ladaao aur raj karo. ' The clip is from a speech the prime minister made on March 21.  2021, when he visited Bokakhat, Assam and spoke at a rally there.  The state goes to polls later this month from March 27 to April 6, 2021.

    "evidence": "Sometimes, people just don\u2019t assimilate accurate information, even when it\u2019s virtually handed to them, because they remain focused on something that is untrue yet so alarming or sensational that it commands their attention and drowns out consideration of contradictory facts. Case in point: the following meme, which was widely circulated via social media in mid-2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic:  The meme\u2019s allusions to presidential candidate Joe Biden, vaccines, secret patents, and the furtive tracking of citizens pushed so many conspiracy theory buttons that many viewers missed the statement at the bottom of the meme that said \u201cnone of this is true.\u201d As the bottom portion of the meme text states, the person referenced here is William A. Mitchell \u2014 a real scientist, but not one involved with the development of vaccines. Mitchell was a food scientist, the person responsible for developing such well known tasty treats as Cool Whip topping, Pop Rocks candy, and Tang powdered drinks. Mitchell retired in 1976, and died in 2004, so clearly he had nothing to do with patenting a vaccine \u2014 or anything else \u2014 in 2012. The point of someone compiling this memetic factual tomfoolery is stated at the bottom of the graphic: a warning to viewers to \u201cStop getting your news from memes and calling it research!\u201d We note, for the record, that even the meme\u2019s deliberate attempt at presenting misinformation was wrong, whether intentionally or otherwise. Although the photograph used in the meme appears on a web page about Mitchell, it\u2019s actually a picture of Oswald Theodore Avery, a Canadian-American physician and medical researcher.",

    "claim": "This is how the Jussie Smollett investigation went down, according to Chicago police https://t.co/9yMDff46d7 https://t.co/g2SrpACJBs",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct. Jussie Smollett charged with felony, out on bond for allegedly staging hoax attackA Chicago judge set Jussie Smollett's bond at $100,000 on Thursday and ordered him to surrender his passport, hours after a remarkable Chicago Police Department press conference in which Superintendent Eddie T.  Johnson blasted the 'Empire' star, saying that Smollett's alleged staging of a hoax attack was a \"publicity stunt. . . to promote his career. \"The weeks-long investigation into the alleged hate crime attack \u2013- an alarming account that sizzled with a spectrum of hot button issues ranging from race, sexuality and politics to crime and celebrity -- riveted and distressed a deeply-divided nation. Standing before Cook County Circuit Court Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, Jr. , Smollett appeared to remain steadfast in his refutation of the felony charge against him.  He has repeatedly insisted that the attack was real and that he was merely a victim, not a perpetrator.  If convicted of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false report, the actor faces up to three years in prison. When first assistant state attorney Risa Lanier told Lyke that the actor had picked up two brothers who authorities say carried out the staged attack on him at his direction and showed them the location of where he wanted to be attacked, Smollett shook his head in disagreement. When Lyke told Smollett that the allegations, if true, are \"utterly outrageous,\" the actor nodded his head in agreement -- doing so again when Lyke said the noose detail would be the most despicable part of the alleged scheme. The judge also ordered pre-trial monitoring of the actor, and ordered him to stay away from the two brothers he allegedly conspired with to stage the hoax attack, according to police. Smollett's next court appearance is scheduled for March 14. The tense courtroom appearance followed on the heels of a morning press conference at which a visibly angry Johnson castigated the actor for betraying his race and his city with such an incendiary false claim. \"Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,\" a visibly angry Johnson said.  \u201cI am left hanging my head asking \u2018why? \u2019.  Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?  . . .  How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims? \"Johnson charged that Smollett, an actor on the hit show 'Empire' who has consistently denied any role in staging the alleged attack, orchestrated it because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary. \"In addition to staging the attack, officials said, Smollett also sent himself a hate-filled letter to the Fox studio where the hit show is filmed. Smollett turned himself in at 5:15 a. m.  local time and made a statement to police before being taken into custody.  His lawyers, Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, were not present at the time but they released a statement the night before. \"Like any other citizen, Mr.  Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.  Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense. \"Thursday evening, the attorneys released a statement criticizing law enforcement's handling of the case. \"Today we witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.  The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr.  Smollett and notably, on the eve of a Mayoral election,\" the statement read.  \"Mr.  Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing. \"BacklashPolice add that Smollett gave no statement to police after turning himself in and that his lawyers had reached out to them Wednesday night to discuss his surrender.  Smollett wanted to turn himself in near midnight, but authorities suggested he come in at 5 a. m.  instead, to avoid spending the night in jail.  Smollett arrived early Thursday morning accompanied by a female lawyer and an entourage of five or six people. Smollett was silent as he went through the motions of being booked and processed. By late morning on Thursday, the backlash against the actor began at the top, with an angry tweet from the President of the United States. \". @JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments! ?  #MAGA\" President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet after the press conference. In an earlier interview with ABC News, Smollett was asked why he thought he was targeted and he replied that he is a strident critic of the Trump administration. \u201cI come really really hard against 45,\" he said.  referring to Trump, the 45th U. S.  president.  \"I come really really hard against his administration, and I don\u2019t hold my tongue. \u201d'I'm offended'During a press briefing later Thursday morning, Chicago law enforcement officials said that Chicago police detectives interviewed more than 100 people and reviewed dozens of police cameras trying to get to the bottom of Smollett's claims. How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims? Johnson, a well-regarded and popular big city police chief and Chicago native, appeared genuinely aggrieved as he described how, he said, Smollett took advantage of the pain of racism to advance his career. \"Why would anyone use the symbol of a noose\" to further his \"own public profile,\" Johnson wondered aloud. \"I'm offended by what happened and I'm angry,\" Johnson continued.  \"This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn\u2019t own and certainly didn\u2019t deserve. \"Johnson, who oversees one of the nation's largest police departments in one of its most violent cities, seemed disheartened by all the attention paid to the Smollett affair. \u201cThe accusation within this phony attack received national attention for weeks,\u201d Johnson told reporters during a press conference.  \u201cCelebrities, news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor. \"\"When you get the opportunity,\" he said with a mixture of derision and frustration, \"the shooting victims and their families?  Give them the same amount of attention. \"After the press briefing, 20th Century Fox, the station that airs \"Empire,\" released a statement which read, \"We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process.  We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our options. \"'Self-inflicted' woundsSmollett told police he was attacked by two masked men near his apartment in Chicago.  The two men, Smollett initially said, shouted racist and homophobic slurs at him as a rope was wrapped around his neck and a chemical compound was poured on him.  The alleged assailants yelled \"MAGA country,\" a reference to President Donald Trump's \"Make American Great Again\" slogan, police were told. Chicago trusted this young man.  We loved 'Empire,' and we took this very seriously that something this hateful could happen in our city. In an interview with \"Good Morning America\" anchor Robin Roberts, Smollett said he was heartbroken when he found out that people questioned his story. Asked why he would leave the rope draped around his neck until police arrived because he \"wanted them to see. \"\"I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out,\" he told Roberts.  \"I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck.  So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me.  . . .  I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around.  But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see. \"Asked why he wait until the second interview to tell police that the assailants yelled \u201cMAGA country\u201d at him during the attack, Smollett seemed to take offense at the insinuation. \"For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know?  And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,\" Smollett said on ABC News.  \"I didn't need to add anything like that.  They called me a f----, they called me a n----.  There's no which way you cut it. \"'Chicago trusted this young man'Johnson said on Thursday that Smollett's seeming injuries from the incident also appeared to be phony. \u201cThe brothers had on gloves during the staged attack where they -- they punched him a little bit, but as far as we can tell, the scratches and bruising that you saw on his face was most likely self-inflicted. \"Police identified and questioned two \"persons of interest\" captured on surveillance video near the scene around the time of the alleged attack.  The men, who are brothers, were arrested on Feb.  13 but then released without charges, with police saying they were no longer considered suspects. While being questioned by investigators, the brothers claimed that Smollett paid them to help orchestrate and stage the crime after he became upset that a letter threatening him, sent Jan.  22 to the Fox studio where \"Empire\" is filmed, did not get enough attention, sources told ABC News. On Wednesday, Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false crime report.  By that evening, police officially had classified the actor as a suspect in the ongoing investigation.  Detectives subsequently presented evidence to a Cook County grand jury. \"That was a pretty hateful allegation, and it really put a terrible look on Chicago,\" Guglielmi told ABC Chicago station WLS in a telephone interview Thursday morning.  \"Chicago trusted this young man.  We loved 'Empire,' and we took this very seriously that something this hateful could happen in our city. \"ABC News' Monica Escobedo, Andy Fies, Will Gretsky, Michael Rothman and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "claim": "NSAI is an abbreviation of the Nashville Songwriters Association International.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Nashville Songwriters Association International is a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- not-for-profit trade organization that works to help songwriters in three ways : through legislative advocacy , through education and advice about the actual craft of songwriting , and through teaching about the music industry , and how to best position a song for success within it . They own the Bluebird Cafe .   HISTORY OF NSAI   As songwriters know , sometimes the best ideas appear during lunch , and that was the case more than 40 years ago with songwriters Eddie Miller , Buddy Mize and Bill Brock . In 1967 , over lunch at Ireland 's Restaurant in Nashville , the three came up with an idea to build a community : a songwriters association .   That kernel of an idea , planted and nurtured four decades ago , took root and has since grown into the 4,500 + member Nashville Songwriters Association International -LRB- NSAI -RRB- , which today promotes awareness of songwriters ' cultural contributions -LRB- through events such as Tin Pan South Songwriters Festival -RRB- , champions the legal rights of professional songwriters and helps develop the abilities of aspiring songwriters .   But such growth and prosperity did n't occur overnight . Back in the late ` 60s , Nashville 's songwriting community consisted of only a few dozen writers who received little credit for their achievements and whose royalty compensation was small , largely because of an antiquated copyright law . Additionally , outside of the performing rights societies ASCAP , BMI and SESAC , songwriter recognition was virtually non-existent .   Then , one November day in 1967 , Miller -LRB- a 1975 inductee into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and founding member of the Academy of Country Music in California -RRB- encouraged fellow songwriters Mize and Brock to begin an association for writers in Nashville . Mize and Brock loved the idea , and all three set out to make it happen .   Within a month , Eddie , Buddy and Bill were conducting the group 's first organizational meeting at the Old Professional 's Club on Music Row . The meeting attracted some 40 songwriters , including Liz & Casey Anderson -LRB- `` The Fugitive '' -RRB- , Felice & Boudleaux Bryant -LRB- `` Wake Up Little Susie '' -RRB- , Kris Kristofferson -LRB- `` Me And Bobby McGee '' -RRB- and Marijohn Wilkin -LRB- `` One Day At A Time '' -RRB- . Those 40 -- more than half the songwriters in town at that time -- became the founding membership of NSAI and began spending countless hours around Marijohn 's kitchen table brainstorming , discussing and refining ideas .   Within a year , the Nashville Songwriters Association was chartered by the state of Tennessee as a not-for-profit trade association , and from that moment , NSAI would go on to make a difference for all songwriters by helping to revise antiquated copyright laws and to establish new intellectual property protection in the digital age , by establishing a network of over 90 songwriter workshops to provide local instruction at home and abroad , and by conducting more than a half dozen educational conferences and awards shows each year .   And though based in Nashville , NSAI represents all musical genres and includes songwriters from across the United States and overseas . NSAI provides a haven for both proven and undiscovered writers -- to get a cup of coffee , to make a phone call or just to receive a word of advice or consolation . To quote NSAI 's motto : `` IT ALL BEGINS WITH A SONG '' -- and , sometimes , it all begins over lunch .   About   The Nashville Songwriters Association International -LRB- NSAI -RRB- is the world 's largest not-for-profit songwriters trade association . Established in 1967 , the membership of more than 5,000 active and pro members spans the United States and six other countries . NSAI is dedicated to protecting the rights of and serving aspiring and professional songwriters in all genres of music .   Mission Statement   The Nashville Songwriters Association International -LRB- NSAI -RRB- consists of a body of creative minds , including songwriters from all genres of music , professional and amateur , who are committed to protecting the rights and future of the profession of songwriting , and to educate , elevate , and celebrate the songwriter and to act as a unifying force within the music community and the community at large .   The association was founded in the 1970s , with former singer-songwriter Lorene Mann as a co-founder .   Songwriters Caucus -- NSAI established Songwriters Caucuses in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate . In Congress , a `` caucus '' is a group of like-minded lawmakers who share a philosophical pre-disposition to support an issue .   When NSAI has an issue before Congress , we now have caucus members who will help us by co-sponsoring legislation , allowing songwriters to testify , and using the power of their offices and the media to represent the songwriter view .   FEDERAL COURT CASES   Eldred vs. Ashcroft -- NSAI filed an `` amicus brief '' with the United States Supreme Court in a case that determined how long you and your heirs will own your copyrights . NSAI was the only songwriter organization to meet with the Justice Department attorneys , arguing the case on behalf of copyright owners . NSAI songwriter and Constitutional scholar Peter McCann researched the diaries of founding father James Madison . Madison authored Section 1 , Article 8 of the United States Constitution that says : `` Congress may grant , for a ` limited time ' , to authors and composers ... '' At issue was the definition of `` limited time . '' McCann found that Madison intended for his own diaries to be published after his death by his family , FOR PROFIT ! This compelling argument influlenced the Supreme Court 's decision in favor of copyright owners and their heirs . ",

Photos of a woman cutting the tricolour cake and holding a piece of cake with Ashoka Chakra symbol is shared in the post.  Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post. Claim: Facebook India\u2019s Public Policy Director Ankhi Das, disrespected the country by cutting a cake with the Indian tricolour. Fact: The woman shown in the post is Sangeetha Bahadur, the Indian Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus.  Sangeeta Bahadur had cut the tricolour Indian Flag cake on the occasion of 74th Independence day celebrations at Indian Embassy in Minsk, Belarus.  It has nothing to do with Facebook India\u2019s Executive Ankhi Das.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. On reverse image search of the photos shared in the post, we found similar photos in a post shared by Sangeeta Bahadur in her official Facebook page.  Sangeeta Bahadur, the Indian Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus, shared these photos as the celebrations of India\u2019s 74th Independence day at Indian Embassy in Minsk, Belarus. Photo of Sangeeta Bahadur beside the tricolour Indian flag cake is also found in the official website of \u2018Embassy of India in Minsk, Belarus\u2019.  They also shared the photos of the Independence day celebration event on their official twitter handle.  It can be seen here. The difference between the facial features of Indian Ambassador Sangeeta Bahadur and Facebook India Executive Ankhi Das can be seen belowTo sum it up, Sangeeta Bahadur, the Indian Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus is falsely portrayed as the Facebook India\u2019s Executive Ankhi Das.

Owen visits and informs him that his mother has died (albeit naturally) and that he's going to New York City for the release of his own book. Unfortunately for Larry, Owen reveals that his book is also about their experiences together. Thinking that his book has been scooped once again, an enraged Larry proceeds to strangle him, but stops when Owen shows him that his book is a children's pop-up book called \"Momma, and Owen, and Owen's Friend, Larry\" with the story drastically altered to be suitable for children.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Subhas Chandra Bose -LRB- 23 January 1897 -- 18 August 1945 -RRB- was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India , but whose attempt during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy . The honorific Netaji -LRB- Hindustani : `` Respected Leader '' -RRB- , first applied in early 1942 to Bose in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin , was later used throughout India .   Bose had been a leader of the younger , radical , wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s , rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939 . However , he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command . He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940 .   Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941 , where the leadership offered unexpected , if sometimes ambivalent , sympathy for the cause of India 's independence , contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities . In November 1941 , with German funds , a Free India Centre was set up in Berlin , and soon a Free India Radio , on which Bose broadcast nightly . A 3,000-strong Free India Legion , comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps , was also formed to aid in a possible future German land invasion of India . By spring 1942 , in light of Japanese victories in southeast Asia and changing German priorities , a German invasion of India became untenable , and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia . Adolf Hitler , during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 , suggested the same , and offered to arrange for a submarine . During this time Bose also became a father ; his wife , or companion , Emilie Schenkl , whom he had met in 1934 , gave birth to a baby girl in November 1942 . Identifying strongly with the Axis powers , and no longer apologetically , Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943 . In Madagascar , he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943 .   With Japanese support , Bose revamped the Indian National Army -LRB- INA -RRB- , then composed of Indian soldiers of the British Indian army who had been captured in the Battle of Singapore . To these , after Bose 's arrival , were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and Singapore . The Japanese had come to support a number of puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions , such as those in Burma , the Philippines and Manchukuo . Before long the Provisional Government of Free India , presided by Bose , was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Bose had great drive and charisma -- creating popular Indian slogans , such as `` Jai Hind , '' -- and the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region , ethnicity , religion , and even gender . However , Bose was regarded by the Japanese as being militarily unskilled , and his military effort was short-lived . In late 1944 and early 1945 the British Indian Army first halted and then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack on India . Almost half the Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent were killed . The INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula , and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore . Bose had earlier chosen not to surrender with his forces or with the Japanese , but rather to escape to Manchuria with a view to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to be turning anti-British . He died from third degree burns received when his plane crashed in Taiwan . Some Indians , however , did not believe that the crash had occurred , with many among them , especially in Bengal , believing that Bose would return to gain India 's independence .   Indian National Congress , the main instrument of Indian nationalism , praised Bose 's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology , especially his collaboration with Fascism . The British Raj , though never seriously threatened by the INA , charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials , but eventually backtracked in the face both of popular sentiment and of its own end .

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "In basketball , a block or blocked shot occurs when a defensive player legally deflects a field goal attempt from an offensive player . The defender is not allowed to make contact with the offensive player 's hand -LRB- unless the defender is also in contact with the ball -RRB- or a foul is called . In order to be legal , the block must occur while the shot is traveling upward or at its apex . A deflected field goal that is made does not count as a blocked shot and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team . Every successful blocked shot is counted as a missed field goal attempt for the shooter . Also , on a shooting foul , a blocked shot can not be awarded or counted , even if the player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who committed the foul . If the ball is heading downward when the defender hits it , it is ruled as goaltending and counts as a made basket . Goaltending is also called if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard -LRB- NFHS excepted ; the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009 -- 10 season -RRB- .   Nicknames for blocked shots include `` rejections , '' `` stuffs , '' `` bushed '' , `` fudged '' , or notably `` double-fudged '' -LRB- two-handed blocks -RRB- , `` facials , '' `` swats , '' `` denials , '' and `` packs . '' Blocked shots were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973 -- 74 season .   Largely due to their height and position near the basket , centers and power forwards tend to record the most blocks , but shorter players with good jumping ability can also be blockers , an example being Dwyane Wade , the shortest player , at 6 ' 4 '' , to record 100 blocked shots in a single season . A player with the ability to block shots can be a positive asset to a team 's defense , as they can make it difficult for opposing players to shoot near the basket and by keeping the basketball in play , as opposed to swatting it out of bounds , a blocked shot can lead to a fast break , a skill Bill Russell was notable for . To be a good shot-blocker , a player needs great court sense and timing , and good height or jumping ability . One tactic is that a shot-blocker can intimidate opponents to alter their shots , resulting in a miss . ",

But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart , Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together .

The Quint received a query regarding the video on its WhatsApp number. The video has also been shared on Facebook. TRUE OR FALSE? The video is from 2018 and the incident it shows took place in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district. It is being recirculated in the wake of the doctors' strike in West Bengal. WHAT WE FOUND OUT The time stamp on the CCTV clip clearly mentions the video is from 24 October 2018. We conducted a search on Google with the key words 'doctor CCTV' within the time frame 24 October-26 October 2018. This led us to a local news channel IBC24's report on the incident, which said that it took place in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind. According to the news report, the doctor was beaten by the family members of a woman, who had lost her life at the district hospital while waiting for an ambulance to take her to Gwalior, where she had been referred. The report adds that the guard who had been posted at the hospital was an inactive witness to the attack and did not do anything to prevent the patient\u2019s kin from attacking the doctor. The incident was also reported by News18 Madhya Pradesh. ",

The Czech Republic covers an area of 78866 km2 with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague , with over 1.2 million residents . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia .   The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . After the fall of the Empire in 907 , the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the P\u0159emyslid dynasty . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire , becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Besides Bohemia itself , the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown , he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor , and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Protestant Bohemian Reformation , the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five consecutive crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church .   Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt -LRB- 1618 -- 20 -RRB- against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism and reimposed Roman Catholicism , and also adopted a policy of gradual Germanization . With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism . In the 19th century , the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia , which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.   The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II , and was liberated in 1945 by the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States . The Czech country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections . Following the 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat , Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence . In 1968 , increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring , which ended in a Soviet-led invasion .   The first separate Czech republic was created on 1 January 1969 , under the name Czech Socialistic Republic within federalization of Czechoslovakia , however the federalization was implemented only incompletely . Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution , when the communist regime collapsed and a democracy and federalization was deepened . On 6 March 1990 , the Czech Socialistic Republic was renamed to the Czech Republic . On 1 January 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved , with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic .   The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- in 2004 ; it is a member of the United Nations , the OECD , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe . It is a developed country with an advanced , high income economy and high living standards . The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development . In 2017 , Czech citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 168 countries and territories , ranking the Czech passport 9th in the world -LRB- after 25 other countries -RRB- . The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country , while achieving strong performance in democratic governance . It has the lowest unemployment rate of EU members . , Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe . The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical , social and cultural identity . Central Europe is going through a phase of `` strategic awakening '' , with initiatives such as the CEI , Centrope and the Visegr\u00e1d Four . While the region 's economy shows high disparities with regard to income , all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed . ",

In this context, few videos are being shared widely on social media with a claim that they show the police beating citizens for coming out during the latest night curfew in Telangana.  Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the posts. Claim: Videos of police beating citizens for coming out during the latest night curfew in Telangana. Fact: The videos in these posts are old.  The same videos are being shared on social media at least since March 2020.  They are not related to the latest night curfew in Telangana.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. Video 1: (archived)When we searched with a few relevant keywords and using a time filter, the video was found to be uploaded by a user back in March 2020.  So, the video is old and not related to the latest night curfew in Telangana. Video 2: (archived)When the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be posted by \u2018Sach News\u2019 YouTube channel in March 2020.  So, this video is also old. Video 3: (archived)This video was also found to be uploaded by a Facebook user in March 2020.  While we could not independently verify the exact locations of the posted videos, it can be concluded that the videos are not related to the latest night curfew in Telangana as they are old videos. To sum it up, old videos are being shared as visuals of police beating citizens for coming out during the latest night curfew in Telangana. ",

R. Martin , and its television adaptation Game of Thrones . Based on an idea that came to Martin while writing the 1981 novel Windhaven , Tyrion has been called one of the author 's finest creations and most popular characters by The New York Times . Martin has named the character as his favorite in the series .   Introduced in 1996 's A Game of Thrones , Tyrion is a dwarf and member of House Lannister , one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros . He subsequently appeared in Martin 's A Clash of Kings -LRB- 1998 -RRB- and A Storm of Swords -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in 2005 's A Feast for Crows , but returned in the next novel A Dance with Dragons -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter . The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister , an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels , in 2013 .   In the story , Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life -- even from his own family . Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously , he soothes his inadequacies with wine , wit , and self-indulgence . But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart , Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together . He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn , then is tasked by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King 's Landing -- as well as his nephew Joffrey , the new king -- as civil war is sparked . Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in ; when his father returns , Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey -- including Tyrion 's own scheming sister Cersei . Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost , and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger , but without his Lannister resources .   Peter Dinklage has garnered enormous praise for his portrayal of the character . In 2011 , Dinklage received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and later the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series , Miniseries , or Television Film for his portrayal of Tyrion in the HBO series . He won the Emmy again in 2015 . Among other accolades , Dinklage has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2016 . ",

He began the first volume of the series , A Game of Thrones , in 1991 and had it published in 1996 . Martin , who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy , has published five out of a planned seven volumes . The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011 , A Dance with Dragons , took Martin five years to write . He is still writing the sixth novel , The Winds of Winter .   A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos . The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine , in the first novel , to thirty-one by the fifth . Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros , the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros , and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen , the deposed king 's exiled daughter , to assume the Iron Throne .   Martin 's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon . A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion , as well as its realism . An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader , and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured . Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire , questions concerning loyalty , pride , human sexuality , piety , and the morality of violence frequently arise .

    "evidence": "Usain St Leo Bolt , OJ , CD -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8ju\u02d0se\u026an -RSB- born 21 August 1986 -RRB- is a Jamaican sprinter . He is the first person to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time became mandatory . He also holds the world record as a part of the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay . He is the reigning world and Olympic champion in these three events . Due to his unprecedented dominance and achievements in sprint competition , he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time .   An eight-time Olympic gold medalist , Bolt won the 100 m , 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 m relay at three consecutive Olympic Games , although he subsequently lost one of the gold medals -LRB- as well as the world record set therein -RRB- nine years after the fact due to teammate Nesta Carter 's disqualification for doping offences . He gained worldwide popularity for his double sprint victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in world record times . Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive olympics -LRB- 2008 , 2012 and 2016 -RRB- , a feat referred to as the `` triple double . ''   An eleven-time World Champion , he won consecutive World Championship 100 m , 200 m and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015 , with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011 . He is the most successful athlete of the World Championships and was the first athlete to win three titles in both the 100 m and 200 m at the competition .   Bolt improved upon his first 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 -- the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing . He has twice broken the 200 metres world record , setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009 . He has helped Jamaica to three 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay world records , with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012 . Bolt 's most successful event is the 200 m , with three Olympic and four World titles . The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m ; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals -LRB- including 2007 World Championship silver -RRB- and holds the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event .   His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname `` Lightning Bolt '' , and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year , Track & Field Athlete of the Year , and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year -LRB- four times -RRB- . Bolt has stated that he intends to retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships . , The 100 metres , or 100-metre dash , is a sprint race in track and field competitions . The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics . It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women .    The reigning 100 m Olympic champion is often named `` the fastest runner in the world . '' The World Championships 100 metres has been contested since 1983 . Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world champions , Bolt and Elaine Thompson are the Olympic champions in the men 's and women 's 100 metres , respectively .   On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . Runners begin in the starting blocks and the race begins when an official fires the starter 's pistol . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 -- 60 m . Their speed then slows towards the finish line .   The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race . The current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2009 , while the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken .   The 100 m -LRB- 109.361 yards -RRB- emerged from the metrication of the 100 yards -LRB- 91.44 m -RRB- , a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries . The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight .   US athletes have won the men 's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country , 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run . US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times . ",

    "evidence": "A disturbing image of a man sitting with the Indian Tricolour wrapped around his shoe is circulating on social media.  Netizens claim he is Pakistan politician Haroon Bilour who was later killed in a bomb blast. Several Twitter and Facebook users shared the picture with a caption in Hindi, which translates to, \u201cHe\u2019d wrapped the Tiranga around his feet.  Pakistan Lok Sabha constituency number 74 candidate Haroon Bilour blown away in an explosion by terrorists. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the man in the picture was Siraj Raisani, a leader of Balochistan Awami Party, known for his stringent anti-India views.  Raisani was among over 130 people killed in 2018 in a suicide attack in Balochistan. On the other hand, Haroon Bilour of Pakistan\u2019s Awami National Party was also killed in a suicide bomb attack in the same year in Peshawar. The archived versions of the posts are saved here and here. Using reverse image and keyword search, we found from several articles hat the viral picture had created a controversy between India and Pakistan in 2018. Major General Asif Ghafoor former spokesperson of the Pakistan army, had shared the photo on Twitter, along with another picture where the same man was seen standing on the Indian national flag. The caption of his tweet read, Salute to our national hero #SirajRaisani.  A truly proud Pakistani who made enemies of Pakistan afraid.  Your passion, mission & message shall be carried forward.  We owe you, and we shall not let your sacrifice go waste.  Welcome to the great family of \u2018Martyred sons of Pakistan\u2019. \u201dSocial media users from India were quick to criticise Ghafoor for sharing the pictures. As per news reports, Balochistan Awami Party leader Siraj Raisani was among the over 130 people killed in a suicide blast by the Islamic State in Balochistan\u2019s Mastung in July 2018. Haroon Bilour , an Awami National Party leader, was among more than 20 people killed in another suicide blast at a party rally in Peshawar in the same month. Both attacks took place days before the general elections were scheduled in Pakistan on July 25, 2018. So, it is clear that the man disrespecting the Indian flag was Siraj Raisani, an anti-India Baloch leader in Pakistan.  He was killed in a suicide blast three years back. The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie. ",

    "evidence": "Ole Miss entered their SEC opener against the top-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide as double digit underdogs, despite having won the previous two meetings. The Ole Miss offense got off to a fast start, with running back Akeem Judd running it in from 23 yards out, taking only 1:53 off the clock. Alabama would get on the board with just under 6 minutes left in the first quarter, when kicker Adam Griffith made a 32-yard field goal. The next three scores would all belong to Ole Miss, starting with a Gary Wunderlich field goal from 23 yards out. Roughly three minutes later, Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly found Evan Engram from 63 yards out to put the Rebels up 17\u20133 with 4:40 left in the half. The Rebels would get their first defensive score of the season when Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts was sacked, and subsequently fumbled the ball. Ole Miss defensive end John Youngblood recovered and returned it 44 yards for Ole Miss's next touchdown, putting Ole Miss up 24\u20133. On the ensuing drive, Alabama had its most productive drive of the game to that point, getting in the red zone for only the second time and finding the end zone when Calvin Ridley found the end zone from six yards out with just over two minutes remaining in the half. After the ensuing Ole Miss drive stalled, the Rebels punted the ball and Alabama return man Eddie Jackson returned the punt 85 yards for another Alabama touchdown, in what would be the final score of the half. Ole Miss entered the second half with a 24\u201317 lead, and the Ole Miss defense stopped Alabama on their opening drive, forcing a punt. On Ole Miss's next possession, Chad Kelly fumbled the ball in his own end zone, and Daron Payne of Alabama recovered, tying the game at 24. After another Ole Miss drive stalled, Alabama managed a field goal from 30 yards out, putting the Tide up 27\u201324. Ole Miss's next drive would the most productive of the second half, as the reached the red zone for the first time since the first half, but only managed a field goal from Gary Wunderlich, tying the game at 27. Alabama scored the final touchdown of the third quarter with 16 seconds left, when Bo Scarborough ran it in from a yard out, putting Alabama up 34\u201327 going into the final quarter of the game. Ole Miss started the fourth quarter with another productive offensive drive, but once again settled for a field goal with 13:17 remaining, cutting the Tide's lead to 4. The next two scores would belong to the Tide, however, when running back Damien Harris ran it in from a yard out. The next score happened when Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly was intercepted by Jonathan Allen and returned 75 yards for a score, putting Alabama up 48\u201330 and seemingly sealing the game with five and a half minutes remaining. Ole Miss scored a touchdown on its ensuing drive, cutting the Tide lead to 11. The Rebels recovered the ensuing onside kick, giving them glimmer of hope. On this possession, Chad Kelly and the Ole Miss offense scored on the first play, when Kelly found A.J. Brown from 37 yards out. The two point conversion failed, but Ole Miss appeared to be back in the game, down only by 5 points with just under three minutes left. However, Alabama was able to run the remaining time out, sealing the victory. Ole Miss lost to Alabama for the first time since 2013 and blew their second 21+ lead in two weeks.Ole Miss entered their rematch against Alabama as heavy underdogs, as the Tide were nine point favorites. However, Ole Miss would be the team who never trailed in the entire game. On the opening kickoff, Alabama fumbled the ball which led to an early Ole Miss field goal only about thirty seconds in, but that would be the only score of the first quarter. The Tide knotted the game up at 3 when Adam Griffith hit a field from twenty yards out with 12:20 left in the second quarter. The Rebels would be responsible for the game's first two touchdowns, when Jordan Wilkins ran it in from one yard on fourth and goal with 7:30 remaining in the first half. Chad Kelly would run it in next, this time from four yards out to put Ole Miss up 17\u20133 with 6:43 left in the half. Alabama managed to put one touchdown on the board before the half, as Ole Miss led at the half, 17\u201310. The first points of the second half would come on an outrageous pass from Chad Kelly to Quincy Adeboyejo from 66 yards out, to put Ole Miss up 24\u201310 with 12:53 left in the third quarter. Ole Miss would then tack on two Gary Wunderlich field goals, one from 34 yards out and one from 45 yards out, which put the Rebels up 30\u201310 with four minutes left in the third quarter. The Tide would score the quarter's final points, when quarterback Jake Coker would run it in with 1:33 left. Alabama would pull to within six points when Coker would find ArDarius Stewart from eight yards out with 12:30 left in the game. Ole Miss's next big play would come when Chad Kelly would find a wide open Cody Core for a 73-yd touchdown strike less than a minute after Alabama pulled to within six. After a failed two point conversion, The Rebels led 36\u201324. Ole Miss would score again when Chad Kelly found Laquon Treadwell from 24 yards out following an Alabama interception to put the Rebels up 43\u201324. The Tide would score with 6:36 left in the game when running back Derrick Henry would find the end zone from two yards out to bring the Tide to within 13. Alabama would also fail on a two-point conversion try, so the score remained 43\u201330. Alabama surprisingly recovered the onside kick that followed, and capitalized with a touchdown from Coker to Richard Mullaney with four and half minutes left. Ole Miss led 43\u201337. After the next Ole Miss drive stalled, Alabama got the ball back down by six points with three minutes left. Their game-winning drive, however, would be terminated by an interception from Coker. Alabama got one final chance with 31 seconds left at their own 30 yard line, but failed to get a first down. Ole Miss beat Alabama in back to back seasons for the first time ever and won in Tuscaloosa for the second time ever. Following Ole Miss's upset win, the Rebels rose to #3 in the rankings, which was the first time since 1963\u201364 that Ole Miss was ranked in the top 3 in back to back seasons.",

The viral image was of a 3D graphic created by an artist called Jacob Eisinger for the February 2015 cover of Modus Magazine.  CLAIM The caption shared with the viral image said, \"This is a german village shaped like fingerprint. \" The same caption was used by several other Facebook and Twitter users.   Archives of more such posts can be found here, here and here.  WHAT WE FOUND OUT On conducting a reverse image search on the viral photo, we found the same image in a different orientation.   The image was created by a German artist called Jacob Eisinger for the February 2015 cover of MODUS magazine.  According to Eisinger's LinkedIn page, he is \"a designer/illustrator focusing on 3D illustration and 3D type\".  The image was also shared by Eisinger, along with images of other artwork, on their Behance profile.   Eisinger had also shared images of process involved in making the final 3D graphic.  The artists also shared the photo on his Instagram handle where he used hashtags like #cgi, #3d and #digitalart.   We also found that the image was viral before in 2018 and was debunked by the fact-checking organisation Snopes.

They were first discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773 . The name Tardigrada -LRB- meaning `` slow stepper '' -RRB- was given three years later by the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani . They have been found everywhere from mountaintops to the deep sea , mud volcanoes , and from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic .   Tardigrades are one of the most resilient animals known : they can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms . They can withstand temperature ranges from 1 K -LRB- close to absolute zero -RRB- to about 420 K for several minutes , pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches , ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human , and the vacuum of outer space . They can go without food or water for more than 30 years , drying out to the point where they are 3 % or less water , only to rehydrate , forage , and reproduce . Tardigrades living in harsh conditions undergo an annual process of cyclomorphosis .   They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions . This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments , whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms .   Usually , tardigrades are about 0.5 mm long when they are fully grown . They are short and plump with four pairs of legs , each with four to eight claws also known as `` disks '' . The first three pairs of legs are directed ventrolaterally and are the primary means of locomotion , while the fourth pair is directed posteriorly on the terminal segment of the trunk and is used primarily for grasping the substrate . Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells , algae , and small invertebrates . When collected , they may be viewed under a very low-power microscope , making them accessible to students and amateur scientists .   Tardigrades form the phylum Tardigrada , part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa . It is an ancient group , with fossils dating from 530 million years ago , in the Cambrian period . About 1,150 species of tardigrades have been described . Tardigrades can be found throughout the world , from the Himalayas -LRB- above 6000 m -RRB- , to the deep sea -LRB- below 4000 m -RRB- and from the polar regions to the equator . ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Yovanovitch alleged that Trump\u2019s handling of U. S.  policy puts America at risk. The biggest moments in former US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch\u2019s hearingMarie \"Masha\" Yovanovitch, a longtime career diplomat, was serving as U. S.  ambassador to Ukraine last spring when she was abruptly ordered home and told that she had lost the confidence of the president.  President Donald Trump in a subsequent phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president called her \"bad news\" and said \"she\u2019s going to go through some things. \"On Friday, she got the chance to tell her side of the story as part of the ongoing House impeachment proceedings. Here are five key takeaways:Yovanovitch directly disputed conspiracy theories embraced by Trump. Yovanovitch repeatedly knocked down suggestions by Republicans that Ukrainian politicians were part of a coordinated, state-sponsored effort to undermine Trump. While true that some prominent politicians in Ukraine had criticized the president, she described those critiques as \u201cisolated incidents\u201d that are common when it comes to public service. \u201cThat does not mean that someone is or a government is undermining either a campaign or interfering in elections,\u201d she said. Yovanovitch also pointed to U. S.  intelligence that found Russian operatives -- at the behest of their government -- engaged in a far more widespread, invasive and secretive campaign to sway voters in support of Trump. Russian President Vladimir Putin, could have been trying to \"throw off the scent\" that Russia was behind election interference and create an \"alternative narrative\" that Ukraine was to blame, she said. Yovanovitch added she would not have recommended an investigation into Hunter Biden had she remained Ukraine's ambassador.  She said Hunter Biden\u2019s work with a Ukraine gas company does represent the appearance of a conflict of interest, but didn\u2019t warrant a corruption probe. \u201cThe Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign,\u201d she said.  \u201cNor would I have taken such steps if they had. \u201dRepublicans and Democrats thanked her for her service, as Trump knocked her on TwitterA long-running theme in the hearing was Yovanovitch\u2019s 33 years in public service.  Republicans went to great lengths to acknowledge her work as a career diplomat. But the hearing was underway for only an hour when Trump lobbed tweets aimed at her, claiming that \"everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. \"\"Would you like to respond to the president's attack that everywhere you went 'turned bad\u2019? \" California Rep.  Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, asked Yovanovitch. \"I don't think I have such powers,\" she said, adding that she believes her and her colleagues have made the places she's been \"demonstrably better. \"Schiff later told reporters he thought Trump\u2019s tactic was \"witness intimidation. \" During the hearing, he asked Yovanovitch whether such tweets might discourage others from coming forward with allegations of wrongdoing. \"Well, it's very intimidating,\" she said. \"It's designed to intimidate, is it not? \" Schiff asked. \"I mean, I can't speak to what the president is trying to do,\" she said.  \"But I think the effect is to be intimidating. \"White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said: \u201cThe tweet was not witness intimidation, it was simply the President\u2019s opinion, which he is entitled to. \u201dNo GOP lawmaker though appeared to follow the president\u2019s lead in attacking her personally. Yovanovitch says she had three contacts with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and remains in the dark as to his motives. One allegation in the impeachment inquiry is that Giuliani -- acting on behalf of the president -- sidelined American diplomats and official U. S.  policy to pursue the widely debunked theory that corrupt Ukrainian politicians interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help the Democratic candidate, former Sec.  of State Hillary Clinton. Yovanovitch said she only had contact with Trump\u2019s lawyer three times and not involving the allegations at hand. \"I do not understand Mr.  Giuliani's motives for attacking me, not can I offer an opinion on whether he believed the allegations he spread about me,\" she said.  \"Clearly no one at the State Department did. \"Yovanovitch added, \"What I can say is that Mr.  Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect -- coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine. \"She described the toll on her personally and professionallyRepublicans repeatedly pointed out that it was well within Trump\u2019s right as president to recall Yovanovitch for any reason. Yovanovitch testified this was indeed the case.  But at multiple points in the hearing, she described the difficulty of being essentially fired, without any reason given other than she had lost the confidence of the president.  She also wondered why Trump and Giuliani went out of their way to try to discredit her personally. \u201cIn my line of work, perhaps in your line of work as well, all we have is our reputation,\u201d she told lawmakers.  \u201cAnd so this has been a very painful period. \u201dShe later added: \u201cWhy it was necessary to smear my reputation falsely? \u201dYovanovitch says her experience in Ukraine could green light corruption abroadIn her opening statement, Yovanovitch described her job in patriotic and inspiring terms but laid out the risks involved.  She recalled being thrown into dangerous situations without the protection of body armor or weapons.  And in Ukraine, she described going to its border with Russia 10 times to wave the American flag to make clear that the U. S.  opposed Moscow\u2019s attempt to expand its power. Most concerning though is that American diplomats are being put in dangerous situations without the full backing of the U. S.  government, she maintained.  She warned that under Trump the State Department was being \"hollowed out from within. \u201d\"Sometimes we get people really angry with us,\" Yovanovich said of foreign officials.  \"It's uncomfortable, and we are doing our jobs \u2026 And if they realize that they can just remove us, they\u2019re going to do that. \"When asked if during her 33 years as a foreign service officer if she had ever heard of a president recalling an ambassador without cause and because of allegations the State Department knew to be false, she replied: \"No. \"ABC\u2019s Ben Siegel contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The ninth round of discussions between the government and farm unions on Friday ended in a deadlock with the next round set for January 19. During the meeting, union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar urged the farmers to be flexible and asserted that the government has been accommodative and has already accepted several demands. The government also proposed that the 41-member farmers\u2019 delegation form a \u201csmaller group\u201d with \u201cpeople who have expertise on laws\u201d. \u201cThere were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision.  We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,\u201d Tomar said.  Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.

Read moreCongress leaders including Bhupinder Singh Hooda taken into custody during protest march over farm lawsCongress leader and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda along with several Haryana Congress leaders were detained on Friday by police as they marched towards the Raj Bhawan in Chandigarh in protest against the new farm laws.  Hooda along with state party chief Kumari Selja, general secretary Randeep Surjewala and other party leaders were taken into preventive detention here by the Chandigarh Police and first taken to the Sector 3 police station.  The police released some party workers but they were again taken into custody as they tried to move towards Haryana Raj Bhawan. \"We are standing in support of farmers since day one.  We are not afraid of going to jail.  No matter how many times we put into the jail, the government cannot stop us,\" Hooda said. Congress' protest on farm law 'political hypocrisy': Rajasthan BJP chiefRajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia on Friday said the Congress is shrinking across the country and using the state to save its credibility.  His comments were in reaction to a sit-in staged by Congress workers here against recent farm laws of the Centre and the rising fuel prices.  Describing it as \"political hypocrisy\", Poonia said the frustration of power slipping out of the Congress's hand is visible on the faces of its leaders, adding that \"they should get used to sit in the opposition\".  The BJP leader also said the Congress has no moral right to talk about farmers as it did no good to them even after being in power in the country for 50 years.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Mariah Carey -LRB- born March 27 , 1969 or 1970 -RRB- is an American singer , songwriter , record producer , and actress . In 1990 , she rose to fame with the release of `` Vision of Love '' from her eponymous debut album . The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbias highest selling act . Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995 -- 96 with `` One Sweet Day , '' which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history . Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola , Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly -LRB- 1997 -RRB- . In 1998 , she was honored as the world 's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000 .   Carey parted with Columbia in 2000 , and signed a record-breaking $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America . In the weeks prior to the release of her film Glitter and its accompanying soundtrack in 2001 , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion . The project was poorly received and led to a general decline in the singer 's career . Carey 's recording contract was bought out for $ 50 million by Virgin and she signed a multi-million dollar deal with Island Records the following year . After a relatively unsuccessful period , she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi -LRB- 2005 -RRB- . The album became the best-selling album in the US and the second best-seller worldwide in 2005 and produced `` We Belong Together , '' which became her most successful single of the 2000s , and was later named `` Song of the Decade '' by Billboard . Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious -LRB- 2009 -RRB- , and was awarded the `` Breakthrough Performance Award '' at the Palm Springs International Film Festival .   Throughout her career , Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide , making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time . According to the RIAA , she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States , with 63.5 million certified albums . With the release of `` Touch My Body '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States , more than any other solo artist . In 2012 , the singer was ranked second on VH1 's list of the `` 100 Greatest Women in Music . '' Aside from her commercial accomplishments , Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards , 19 World Music Awards , 11 American Music Awards , and 14 Billboard Music Awards and has been consistently credited with inspiring a generation of singers . Referred to as the `` songbird supreme '' by the Guinness World Records , she has a five-octave vocal range , power , melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register . , The whistle register -LRB- also called the flute register or whistle tone -RRB- is the highest register of the human voice , lying above the modal register and falsetto register . This register has a specific physiological production that is different from the other registers , and is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register is similar to that of a whistle .   In some sopranos , the modal register vocal production may extend into what is usually thought of as the whistle register . With proper vocal training , it is possible for women within all voice types to develop this part of the voice . However , some women are unable to phonate or comfortably produce sound in this register . Children can also phonate in the whistle register and , rarely , some men . ",

The techie, who hails from Hyderabad and works in a software company in Bengaluru, went to Dubai on February 17 on an official assignment.  \u201cThere he supposedly contracted the virus, possibly while working with some colleagues from Hong Kong,\u201d the minister told reporters.  The Union Health Ministry had earlier on Monday announced that two people had tested positive for Coronavirus making them the fourth and fifth in India to have contracted the virus.  One person has been detected with the virus in New Delhi while the other is this software engineer from Telangana.  The techie returned to Bangalore on February 20 and had fever.  \u201cHe attended office for two days, before arriving at his parents\u2019 place in Hyderabad on February 22, complaining of fever again.  He then visited Apollo Hospital and began taking treatment as an outpatient,\u201d Rajender said. On March 1, the doctors grew suspicious about the symptoms as he was not getting any relief from fever and cough.  They collected his samples and got it tested at the Gandhi Hospital.  Subsequently, the samples were sent to Pune, where they tested positive for Coronavirus. \u201cWe got the confirmation of his samples testing positive for Coronavirus on Monday and shared the information with the Government of India,\u201d Rajender said. He said at least 70 people who came in close contact with him will undergo tests.  Of them, 27 are passengers who travelled with him in the bus from Bengaluru to Hyderabad and 20 medical staff at the Apollo Hospital at Secunderabad, where he underwent treatment for fever and the rest were members of his joint family. \u201cAll the 70 people have been contacted and were advised to undergo tests,\u201d he said. Rajender said the Karnataka government might request the airlines to screen the passengers who were in the flight in which he had travelled from Dubai on February 19 and 20. Several suspected cases of Coronavirus in Hyderabad and several other places in Telangana and in Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Rajahmundry and some other places in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh have tested negative in the last 50 days. The health ministry has granted a Coronavirus testing lab at the state-run Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, to ensure quick diagnosis and treatment. All those coming from Coronavirus infested countries have been screened at the Hyderabad International Airport before being allowed to go out. ",

    "claim": "The US Postal Service is warning states that voters risk not getting their ballots back to election offices in time because of lags in mail delivery, according to letters reviewed by CNN. https://t.co/3PwCw4wRGK https://t.co/puRhUfvJ0L",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Pa.  official pushes to count mail-in votes received after Election Day. USPS warns at least 23 states\u2019 mail-in ballots might not be delivered in timeThe United States Postal Service has warned election officials in 46 states and the District of Columbia that their absentee voting rules are \u201cincongruous\u201d with the agency\u2019s mail delivery service standards and may result in uncounted ballots, raising further alarms with the viability of a voting platform millions of Americans are expected to use in the run-up to the November vote. In recent weeks, postal service General Counsel Thomas Marshall penned letters warning that states may be over-estimating the speed with which ballots will move through the mail.  If the post office is not afforded a few extra days of leeway to deliver ballots to the election offices, Marshall warned that late-arriving ballots could leave some voters disenfranchised. Only four states received a clean bill of health: Nevada, Rhode Island, New Mexico, and Oregon.  Among those with laws that concern the postal service are several key swing states in the upcoming election. In Pennsylvania, for example, the deadline to request an absentee ballot is one week before election day\u200b, and Michigan allows requests up until four days before.  But in order for it to be counted in either state, under current laws, the ballot must be back in the mail and returned by 8 p. m.  on Election Day.  One week for two deliveries is not enough time, Marshall explained.  He said it could realistically take more than a week for a piece of mail to be sent to the voter and then \u201creturned by mail in time to be counted. \u201d\u201cUnder our reading of your state's election laws \u2026 certain state-law requirements and deadlines appear to be incompatible with the Postal Service's delivery standards and the recommended timeframe,\u201d Marshall wrote, according to one of the letters made public in a court filing Thursday. \u201cAs a result,\u201d he continued, \u201cto the extent that the mail is used to transmit ballots to and from voters, there is a significant risk that, at least in certain circumstances, ballots may be requested in a manner that is consistent with your election rules and returned promptly, and yet not be returned in time to be counted. \u201dApplications and ballots in Pennsylvania may still be delivered to a voter's county election office in person by the specified deadlines. Marshall\u2019s letter to Pennsylvania was made public in a court document filed late Thursday as part of a lawsuit brought by progressive organizations in April.  In the filing, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, Pennsylvania\u2019s chief election official, encouraged the state\u2019s supreme court to allow absentee ballots received after Election Day to be counted as valid \u2013 yet another sign that Americans may have to wait days to learn the winner of the upcoming presidential vote. The remarkable extension request was prompted by Marshall's letter sent two weeks earlier warning Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kim Boockvar that the state\u2019s absentee voting rules \u201care incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards,\u201d effectively posing the risk of inadvertently disenfranchising some voters. Marshall notes in his letters that the postal service issued this same warning to states in May, at which time the agency suggested that election leaders re-examine their absentee voting rules to account for mail delivery standards of service, which are two to five days for First-Class Mail and three to 10 days for Marketing Mail. But in their filing Thursday to the Supreme Court, lawyers representing Boockvar argue that in its July 29 letter, \u201cThe Postal Service\u2019s announcement represents a significant change to the outlook for voting by mail in the general election\u201d \u2013 a reference to possible delays in mail service. As such, to avoid the \u201cstatewide risk of disenfranchisement for significant numbers of voters utilizing mail-in ballots,\u201d lawyers writing on Boockvar\u2019s behalf asked the court to \u201corder that ballots mailed by voters on or before 8 p. m.  on Election Day will be counted if they are otherwise valid and received by the county boards of election on or before the third day following the election. \u201dDespite what would appear to ensure a delay in announcing a winner in the state, lawyers for Boockvar add that they \u201cdo not expect that such an extension would create any significant delay in the reporting of Pennsylvania\u2019s election results. \u201dThe late-in-the-game legal jockeying in Pennsylvania comes amid increased scrutiny of the postal service, which has come under fire in recent weeks after its new postmaster general, the longtime Republican financier Louis Dejoy, enacted a series of procedural reforms that critics say will cause delays in mail service. Those reforms have coincided with a deluge of unfounded attacks on the validity of mail-in voting from President Donald Trump, exacerbating fears that DeJoy\u2019s changes to mail delivery could serve political means of undermining the absentee vote.  The postal service and the White House have repeatedly denied those accusations. For their part, Democrats welcomed the absentee voting extension request in Pennsylvania.  Late Thursday, in an email to supporters, Marc Elias, a lawyer who represents progressive groups who brought the lawsuit, lauded the decision as \u201cGREAT news. \u201d\u201cThanks to our lawsuit and this concession, millions of Pennsylvania voters -- many of whom will cast their ballot by mail for the first time -- now won\u2019t have to worry about their ballot not counting due to mail delays,\u201d Elias wrote. In a brief interview with ABC News, Elias said Thursday he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the latest warnings from the postal service.  \u201cIt\u2019s why we continue to litigate\u2026 around the country,\u201d he added. Election experts note that voters are empowered to avoid having their ballot rejected by requesting and re-submitting their ballots early in the process \u2013 not waiting for the deadline. \u201cThe Postal Service recommends you mail your ballot back at least one week before the deadline before election day.  And we know that almost half the states allow you to request a ballot after that time,\u201d said Tammy Patrick of the nonpartisan Democracy Fund. \u201cIn fact, there's seven states that allow you to request it on Monday for Tuesday's election,\u201d she continued.  \u201cAnd that's just not practical.  Just because you can wait until a deadline, doesn't mean you should. \u201dABC News' Matthew Mosk and Devin Dwyer contributed to this report.

    "evidence": "The Eurasian eagle-owl at one time occurred naturally in Great Britain. Some, including the RSPB have claimed that this was probably by about 10,000\u20139,000 years ago after the last ice age but fossil remains found in Meare Lake Village have indicated the eagle-owl occurring as recently as roughly 2,000 years ago in the fossil record. The lack of presence of the Eurasian eagle-owl in British folklore or writings in recent millennium may indicate the lack of occurrence by this species there. The flooding of the land bridge between Britain and continental Europe may have been responsible for their extirpation as they only disperse over limited distances, although early human persecution presumably played a role as well. Some reportages of eagle-owls in Britain have been revealed to actually be great horned owls or Indian eagle-owls, the latter a particularly popular owl in falconry circuits. Some breeding pairs do still occur in Britain, the exact number of pairs and individuals is not definitely known. The World Owl Trust stated that they believe some eagle-owls occurring in North England and Scotland are naturally occurring, making the flight of roughly from the west coast of Norway to Shetland and the east coast of Scotland, as well as possibly from the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium to the south. Although not migratory, eagle-owls can disperse some notable distances in young birds seeking a territory. Prior studies of eagle-owl distribution have indicated a strong reluctance to cross large bodies of water in the species. Many authorities state that the Eurasian eagle-owls occurring in Britain are individuals that have escaped from captivity. While, until 19th century, wealthy collectors may have released unwanted eagle-owls, despite press to the contrary, there is no evidence of any organization or individual intentionally releasing eagle-owls recently with the intent to establish a breeding population. Many feel that the eagle-owl would be classified as an \"alien\" species. Due to its predatory abilities, many, especially those in the press, have expressed alarm of their effect on \"native\" species. From 1994 to 2007, 73 escaped eagle-owls were not registered as returned, while 50 escapees were re-captured. Several recorded breeding attempts have been studied and most were unsuccessful, due in large part to incidental disturbance by humans and some due to direct persecution, with eggs having been smashed.However, palaeotempestological research allows reconstruction of pre-historic hurricane activity trends on timescales of centuries to millennia. A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the East Coast of the United States. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High\u2014controlled by the North Atlantic oscillation\u2014was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. In fact, few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000 BC\u20131400 BC and again during the most recent millennium; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and AD 1000, when catastrophic hurricanes frequently struck the Gulf coast, and their landfall frequencies increased by a factor of three to five. On the Atlantic coast, probability of landfalling hurricanes has doubled in the recent millennium compared to the one and a half millennia before.",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters in Hong Kong have marched to show their opposition to legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China to face chargesNews headlines today: June 7, 2019HONG KONG -- Hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to voice their opposition to legislation that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China where they could face politically charged trials. The massive demonstration took place three days before the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's government plans to bring the highly contentious bill to the full legislature in a bid to win approval by the end of the month. Police estimated the crowd at 240,000, but organizers said more than 1 million took part. The protest was one of the largest in recent Hong Kong history, underscoring fears over China's broadening footprint in the former British colony.  It appeared to be even bigger than a massive pro-democracy demonstration in 2003 against a proposed national security law, according to Associated Press journalists who covered both events. Late Sunday night, a group of demonstrators broke through barriers at government headquarters, where the march had ended.  The crowd briefly pushed its way into the lobby, but police in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to push the protesters outside.  Most had dispersed by 1 a. m. , but police continued pushing protesters away for kilometers over a period of two to three hours. There was still a strong police presence on streets throughout downtown Hong Kong as of 3 a. m.  Monday. A small group of protesters sat with hands tied on the side of Gloucester Road, surrounded by police. People of all ages took part in the march, some pushing strollers and others carrying canes, chanting slogans in the native Cantonese dialect in favor of greater transparency in government. Kiwi Wong, 27, was among the throng, a member of the younger generation who've grown up enjoying relative prosperity but also growing insecurity about what many see as an erosion of the rights Hong Kong residents have enjoyed. \"If I didn't come out now, I don't know when I would have the chance to express my opinion again,\" Wong said.  \"Because now we've got to this stage, if you don't come out to try to do what you can, then it will end up too late, you won't be able to say or do anything about it. \"Alex Ng, a 67-year-old retiree, said he joined the protest because \"I think that there was never any public consultation about this law, and there are a lot of uncertainties. \"Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has pushed forward with the legislation despite widespread criticism from human rights and business groups.  The amendments have been criticized as eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence by making it easier to send criminal suspects to mainland China, where they could face vague national security charges and unfair trials. \"What can we do to get Carrie Lam to listen to us, how many people have to come out to make her reconsider listening to the public? \" said Miu Wong, a 24-year-old office worker who was among the protesters. Tommy Lam, a 29-year-old who is working on his master's degree, said: \"All these people coming out and marching sends a definite message.  If the government doesn't listen, there will be tension. \"The Hong Kong government said in a statement late Sunday that it respected the right of its opponents to protest. \"We acknowledge and respect that people have different views on a wide range of issues,\" the statement said.  \"The procession today is an example of Hong Kong people exercising their freedom of expression within their rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. \"Hong Kong was guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the so-called \"one country, two systems\" framework.  However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes. Hong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing extradition agreements or to others on an individual basis under a law passed before 1997. China was excluded because of concerns over its poor record on legal independence and human rights.  In recent years, mainland authorities have gone after opponents by accusing them of dubious crimes such as tax evasion, crystalizing worries among critics and others. Lam's government argued that the revisions were needed to close legal loopholes, while opponents say that is merely an excuse to pursue China's agenda of reducing Hong Kong's legal independence. Hong Kong's Legislative Council will table the amendments on the bill on Wednesday. \"The people of Hong Kong want to protect our freedom, our freedom of speech, our rule of law, our judicial system, and also our economic foundation, which is welcome to international investors,\" activist Lee Cheuk-yan, a former Hong Kong legislator, said Sunday.  \"If international investors lose confidence in Hong Kong because of this evil bill, then Hong Kong, economically, would also be destroyed. \"\u2014\u2014\u2014Associated Press videojournalist Raf Wober contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "evidence": "Austria -LRB- listen -RRB- , is a federal republic and a landlocked country of over 8.7 million people in Central Europe . It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north , Hungary and Slovakia to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . The territory of Austria covers 83879 km2 . The terrain is highly mountainous , lying within the Alps ; only 32 % of the country is below 500 m , and its highest point is 3798 m . The majority of the population speaks local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language , and Austrian German in its standard form is the country 's official language . Other local official languages are Hungarian , Burgenland Croatian , and Slovene .   The origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg dynasty , when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire . From the time of the Reformation , many northern German princes , resenting the authority of the Emperor , used Protestantism as a flag of rebellion . The Thirty Years War , the influence of the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of France , the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia , and the Napoleonic invasions all weakened the power of the Emperor in the north of Germany , but in the south , and in non-German areas of the Empire , the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control . During the 17th and 18th centuries , Austria retained its position as one of the great powers of Europe and , in response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French , the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804 . Following Napoleon 's defeat , Prussia emerged as Austria 's chief competitor for rule of a greater Germany . Austria 's defeat by Prussia at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz , during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 , cleared the way for Prussia to assert control over the rest of Germany . In 1867 , the empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary . After the defeat of France in the 1870-1 Franco-Prussian War , Austria was excluded from the new German Empire , although in the following decades , its politics , and its foreign policy , increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led Empire . During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28 , Austria-Hungary , emboldened by a pledge of German support , on July 28 declared war on Serbia because that country had not fully complied with an Austrian ultimatum . Austria was thus the first to go to war in the July Crisis , which would ultimately escalate into World War I.   After the collapse of the Habsburg -LRB- Austro-Hungarian -RRB- Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I , Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German-Austria -LRB- Deutsch\u00f6sterreich -RRB- , later changed to \u00d6sterreich , in an attempt at union with Germany , but this was forbidden under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye -LRB- 1919 -RRB- . The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919 . In 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss . This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945 , after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and Austria 's former democratic constitution was restored . In 1955 , the Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state , ending the occupation . In the same year , the Austrian Parliament created the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently neutral .   Today , Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states . The capital and largest city , with a population exceeding 1.7 million , is Vienna . Other major urban areas of Austria include Graz , Linz , Salzburg and Innsbruck . Austria is one of the richest countries in the world , with a nominal per capita GDP of $ 43,724 . The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2014 was ranked 21st in the world for its Human Development Index . Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 , joined the European Union in 1995 , and is a founder of the OECD . Austria also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995 , and adopted the euro currency in 1999 . , Slovakia -LRB- listen -RRB- , is a landlocked country in Central Europe . It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west , Poland to the north , Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south . Slovakia 's territory spans about 49000 km2 and is mostly mountainous . The population is over 5 million and comprises mostly ethnic Slovaks . The capital and largest city is Bratislava . The official language is Slovak .   The Slavs arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries . In the 7th century , they played a significant role in the creation of Samo 's Empire and in the 9th century established the Principality of Nitra . In the 10th century , the territory was integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary , which itself became part of the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire . After World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Slovaks and Czechs established Czechoslovakia . A separate -LRB- First -RRB- Slovak Republic -LRB- 1939 -- 1945 -RRB- existed in World War II as a client state of Nazi Germany . In 1945 , Czechoslovakia was re-established under Communist rule as a Soviet satellite . In 1989 the Velvet Revolution ended authoritarian Communist rule in Czechoslovakia . Slovakia became an independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia , sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce .   Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with a very high Human Development Index , a very high standard of living and performs favourably in measurements of civil liberties , press freedom , internet freedom , democratic governance and peacefulness . The country maintains a combination of market economy with a comprehensive social security system . Citizens of Slovakia are provided with universal health care , free education and one of the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD . The country joined the European Union in 2004 and the Eurozone on 1 January 2009 . Slovakia is also a member of the Schengen Area , NATO , the United Nations , the OECD , the WTO , CERN , the OSCE , the Council of Europe and the Visegr\u00e1d Group . The Slovak economy is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and 3rd fastest in eurozone . Its legal tender , the Euro , is the world 's 2nd most traded currency . Although regional income inequality is high , 90 % of citizens own their homes . In 2016 , Slovak citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 165 countries and territories , ranking the Slovak passport 11th in the world . Slovakia is the world 's largest per-capita car producer with a total of 1,040,000 cars manufactured in the country in 2016 alone and the 7th largest car producer in the European Union . The car industry represents 43 % of Slovakia 's industrial output , and a quarter of its exports . , Poland -LRB- Polska -LSB- \u02c8p\u0254lska -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Republic of Poland -LRB- -LSB- Rzeczpospolita Polska , links = no -RSB- , -RRB- , is a parliamentary republic in Central Europe . Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions , covering an area of 312679 km2 with a mostly temperate climate . With a population of over 38.5 million people , Poland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union . Poland 's capital and largest city is Warsaw . Other cities include Krak\u00f3w , Wroc\u0142aw , Pozna\u0144 , Gda\u0144sk and Szczecin .   The establishment of a Polish state can be traced back to 966 , when Mieszko I , ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day Poland , converted to Christianity . The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . This union formed the Polish -- Lithuanian Commonwealth , one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe with a uniquely liberal political system which declared Europe 's first constitution .   Following the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century , Poland regained its independence in 1918 with the Treaty of Versailles . In September 1939 , World War II started with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany , followed by the Soviet Union invading Poland in accordance with the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact . More than six million of Poland 's citizens died in the war . After World War II , the Polish People 's Republic was established as a satellite state under Soviet influence . In the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1989 , most notably through the emergence of the Solidarity movement , Poland established itself as a democratic republic .   Poland is the eighth largest and one of the most dynamic economies in the European Union , simultaneously achieving a `` very high '' ranking on the Human Development Index . Additionally , the Polish Stock Exchange in Warsaw is the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe . Poland is a developed and democratic country , with a high-income economy , and a very high standard of living . It also ranks very highly in education , safety and economic freedom . According to the World Bank , Poland has one of the best educational systems in Europe , placing it among the most educated nations . The country provides free university education , state-funded social security and a universal health care system for all citizens . Situated between Eastern and Western European cultures and coined by a changing history , Poland developed a rich cultural heritage , including numerous historical monuments and 14 UNESCO World Heritage Sites . It is visited by approximately 16 million tourists every year -LRB- 2014 -RRB- , making it the 16th most visited country in the world . Poland is a member state of the European Union , the Schengen Area , the United Nations , NATO and the OECD . , The Czech Republic -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8t\u0283\u025bki\u0259 -RSB- , ; \u010cesko , -LSB- \u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u025bsko -RSB- -RRB- , is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west , Austria to the south , Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast . The Czech Republic covers an area of 78866 km2 with a mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague , with over 1.2 million residents . The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia .   The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . After the fall of the Empire in 907 , the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the P\u0159emyslid dynasty . In 1002 , the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire , becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Besides Bohemia itself , the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown , he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor , and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Protestant Bohemian Reformation , the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five consecutive crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church .   Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt -LRB- 1618 -- 20 -RRB- against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War . After the Battle of the White Mountain , the Habsburgs consolidated their rule , eradicated Protestantism and reimposed Roman Catholicism , and also adopted a policy of gradual Germanization . With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism . In the 19th century , the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia , which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.   The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II , and was liberated in 1945 by the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States . The Czech country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections . Following the 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat , Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence . In 1968 , increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring , which ended in a Soviet-led invasion .   The first separate Czech republic was created on 1 January 1969 , under the name Czech Socialistic Republic within federalization of Czechoslovakia , however the federalization was implemented only incompletely . Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution , when the communist regime collapsed and a democracy and federalization was deepened . On 6 March 1990 , the Czech Socialistic Republic was renamed to the Czech Republic . On 1 January 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved , with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic .   The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- in 2004 ; it is a member of the United Nations , the OECD , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe . It is a developed country with an advanced , high income economy and high living standards . The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development . In 2017 , Czech citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 168 countries and territories , ranking the Czech passport 9th in the world -LRB- after 25 other countries -RRB- . The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country , while achieving strong performance in democratic governance . It has the lowest unemployment rate of EU members . , Ukraine -LRB- -LSB- ju\u02d0\u02c8kre\u026an -RSB- \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 , tr . Ukraina -LSB- ukr\u0251\u02c8jin\u0251 -RSB- -RRB- , sometimes called the Ukraine , is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe , bordered by Russia to the east and northeast , Belarus to the northwest , Poland and Slovakia to the west , Hungary , Romania , and Moldova to the southwest , and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast , respectively . Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian . Including Crimea , Ukraine has an area of 603628 km \u00b2 , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world . It has a population of about 42.5 million , making it the 32nd most populous country in the world .   The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC . During the Middle Ages , the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture , with the powerful state of Kievan Rus ' forming the basis of Ukrainian identity . Following its fragmentation in the 13th century , the territory was contested , ruled and divided by a variety of powers , including Lithuania , Poland , the Ottoman Empire , Austria-Hungary , and Russia . A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries , but its territory was eventually split between Poland and the Russian Empire , and later merged fully into Russia .   During the 20th century three periods of independence occurred . The first of these periods occurred briefly near the end of World War I and the second occurred , also briefly , during World War II . However , both of these first two earlier periods would eventually see Ukraine 's territories consolidated back into a Soviet republic within the USSR . The third period of independence began in 1991 , when Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in the aftermath of its dissolution at the end of the Cold War . Ukraine has fiercely maintained its independence as a sovereign state ever since . Before its independence , Ukraine was typically referred to in English as `` The Ukraine '' , but sources since then have moved to drop `` the '' from the name of Ukraine in all uses .   Following its independence , Ukraine declared itself a neutral state . Nonetheless it formed a limited military partnership with the Russian Federation and other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO in 1994 . In the 2000s , the government began leaning towards NATO , and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002 . It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum at some point in the future . Former President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient , and was against Ukraine joining NATO . In 2013 , protests against the government of President Yanukovych broke out in downtown Kiev after the government had decided to suspend the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement and seek closer economic ties with Russia . After this began a several-months-long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the Euromaidan , which later escalated into the 2014 Ukrainian revolution that led to the overthrow of President Yanukovych and his cabinet and the establishment of a new government . These events formed the background for the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 , and the War in Donbass in April 2014 . On 1 January 2016 , Ukraine applied the economic part of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European Union .   Ukraine has long been a global breadbasket because of its extensive , fertile farmlands and is one of the world 's largest grain exporters . The diversified economy of Ukraine includes a large heavy industry sector , particularly in aerospace and industrial equipment .   Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system with separate powers : legislative , executive and judicial branches . Its capital and largest city is Kiev . Taking into account reserves and paramilitary personnel , Ukraine maintains the second-largest military in Europe after that of Russia . The country is home to 42.5 million people -LRB- excluding Crimea -RRB- , 77.8 percent of whom are Ukrainians `` by ethnicity '' , followed by a sizeable minority of Russians -LRB- 17.3 percent -RRB- as well as Romanians/Moldovans , Belarusians , Crimean Tatars , Bulgarians and Hungarians . Ukrainian is the official language and its alphabet is Cyrillic . The dominant religion in the country is Eastern Orthodoxy , which has strongly influenced Ukrainian architecture , literature and music . ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "While votes continue to trickle in, it\u2019s clear Sanders secured a convincing win. Bernie Sanders' big win as candidates look to South CarolinaDemocrats may as well say the words now: Sen.  Bernie Sanders, frontrunner. While votes continue to trickle in, it\u2019s clear that Sanders secured a convincing win in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday.  The Vermont senator left the Silver State with a jackpot likely to land him a delegate lead -- with other campaigns agreeing he could be positioned to never surrender it. But his journey to the nomination is by no means assured.  Ahead, party insiders expect a bruising series of pitched battles over what the Democratic Party is, and how best to defeat President Donald Trump. The campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg saw glimmers in Nevada\u2019s numbers that give them hope. Next weekend brings one more early-voting state offering the chance for breakthroughs, with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg -- armed with an inexhaustible cash reserve is standing on the other side of Super Tuesday. But on Saturday, Sanders blew away a half dozen major rivals to win the first voting state to feature significant diversity.  Powered by a hyper-loyal base, and also a bit more than that, he has now won the popular vote in all three states that have voted, and appears better positioned than all of his rivals to rack up wins in the delegate-heavy states that loom on Super Tuesday and beyond. Sanders spent caucus night in Texas, where he appealed to supporters to help him with the March 3 primary -- and turn the state blue in November. \"Don\u2019t tell anyone -- I don\u2019t want to get them nervous -- we\u2019re going to win the Democratic primary in Texas,\" he told supporters at a rally in San Antonio shortly after the Nevada results were projected by major news organizations. Nevada\u2019s results answered some of the questions surrounding Sanders\u2019 potential appeal to the broad Democratic Party.  But he has come nowhere close to answering all of those questions, including some that grew more urgent and potentially troubling on the eve of the caucuses. His numbers were strong enough to ensure a wave of fresh scrutiny of Sanders, along with no small degree of panic among establishment Democrats about the possibility that Sanders marches to the nomination. Thanks to recent disclosures, some of the concerns about Sanders have a Russian accent.  Those worries are also being stoked by a president and an administration with an incentive to raise doubts about how the Democrats are nominating a candidate. In an interview Saturday, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien rejected intelligence suggesting that the Russians are trying to get Trump reelected, instead asserting that they favor Sanders. \"That's no surprise,\" he told George Stephanopoulos, in an interview to air on ABC\u2019s \"This Week\" Sunday.  \"He honeymooned in Moscow. \"For all the whispers and shouts about Sanders\u2019 status as a self-described \"Democratic socialist,\" and even with a still-crowed field of candidates, there were signs in Saturday\u2019s results suggesting that Sanders is gaining strength. In Iowa, Sanders had more people show up for him at caucus sites, but lost the delegate race to Buttigieg primarily because more caucus-goers realigned in Buttigieg\u2019s favor, selecting him over Sanders as a backup choice. In Nevada, though, Sanders appears to have grown his vote share between the two rounds of caucusing -- a sign, perhaps, that more Democrats are growing comfortable with him and his candidacy. Despite heavy union opposition to Medicare for All, 62% of Nevada caucusgoers said they support a government-run single-payer health care system, according to caucus entrance polls.  That suggests a broad endorsement of a signature Sanders policy from rank-and-file Democrats, notwithstanding warnings from Sanders rivals about its inadvisability and impracticality. Sanders romped among voters under 45, taking 56% of them, while running roughly even among those older than that in Nevada.  He also took more than half of the Latino vote -- no small task in a field that counted seven major candidates competing in the caucuses. Sanders appears to have won only about a quarter of black voters, some 9 points behind Biden, according to entrance polls.  That\u2019s better than Sanders performed among black voters last cycle, but it suggests something of a window for rivals next Saturday in South Carolina, where African-Americans are expected to comprise more than 60 percent of the Democratic primary electorate. \"I'm a Democrat for a simple reason.  I ain\u2019t a socialist,\" Biden said Saturday night, in vowing to storm into South Carolina. Though the final order of finish wasn\u2019t clear Saturday night, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign quickly claimed to have exceeded expectations, with the former mayor signaling an even more aggressive push to confront Sanders before he runs away with the nomination. \"Sen.  Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,\" he told supporters late Saturday. As for other Democratic candidates, it\u2019s possible that the large share of early voting didn\u2019t capture recent momentum for Massachusetts Sen.  Elizabeth Warren, whose strong debate performance last Wednesday came after some 75,000 Nevadans cast their early votes. Minnesota Sen.  Amy Klobuchar also said she would march on through Super Tuesday, where her home state of Minnesota is among the states voting. Then there\u2019s Bloomberg, who didn\u2019t compete in Nevada but has set spending records across virtually every other state.  His main message is about defeating Trump, but his secondary one has grown stronger and clearer: Sanders, he argues, would ensure defeat for the Democrats. With another debate on Tuesday, then the last early-state voting on Saturday, there are a few remaining opportunities for Democrats to consolidate early behind a Sanders alternative. But if their main argument is that Sanders is hijacking a party with a narrow slice of voters, it\u2019s worth noting that his share of the pie appears to be growing. It may be that Sanders is taking over a party that wants to be taken where he\u2019s long been going. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The claim in the screenshot is that the head of Goliath, a character in the Bible, was exhumed at the feet of Mount Elah as discovered by German Archaeologist Dr.  Martin.  Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim. Claim: Image of Goliath\u2019s skull exhumed at the feet of Mount Elah as discovered by German Archaeologist Dr.  Martin. \u00a0 \u00a0Fact: The image of \u2018two men exhuming a skull\u2019 is an entry of a photoshop contest seeking hoax archaeological discovery.  The image is not related to any true event.  And, the news clip in the screenshot is that of \u2018Weekly World News\u2019, a tabloid ill-reputed for publishing sensational and fake news.  So, the claim is FALSE. \u00a0The screenshot had a news clip of \u2018Weekly World News\u2019.  So when searched for that article, it was found and known to have been published in June-1993.  In the article, it was written that a leading Archaeologist Dr.  Martin has claimed to have found Goliath\u2019s skull in a valley west of Jerusalem.  So, when looked for other news reports about it, a few other websites were found to have carried news regarding the same news clip of Weekly World News (WWN).  But, there are no reports of any prominent newspapers regarding the exhuming of Goliath\u2019s skull discovered by archaeologist Dr.  Martin.  When looked for the credibility of WWN, reports were found that the tabloid was known to be ill-reputed for publishing stories based on sensationalism and fake news.  More information about the nature and credibility of the news that was published by WWN tabloid can be read here. \u00a0\u00a0 From an article of \u2018Snopes\u2019, it was found that the photograph of \u2018two men exhuming a skull\u2019 is actually an entry of a photoshop contest seeking hoax archaeological discovery.  So, the image is not that of a true event. To conclude, the image of an entry of a photoshop contest is being shared as Goliath\u2019s skull exhumed at Mount Elah.

    "evidence": "Three Rajasthan residents have requested the Central government to grant visas to their Pakistani wives, enabling them to travel to India by the road route in view of their poor financial condition, which has prevented their wives to avail of the offer of visa by the Indian high commission through the air route, according to the affected residents.These cross border couples, living separately on two different sides of the Indo-Pakistan border for at least past two years, were overjoyed when the Indian high commission agreed to give their wives visas to travel to join their husbands via air routes. On February 9, officials of the Indian high commission in Pakistan asked the women to submit documents for visa, which they stated, will be valid for travel through the air route.A week passed since then but the brides in Pakistan did not submit the documents. Reason is simple- the families can\u2019t afford to travel by air.Mahendra Singh Girab, a resident of Khejad Ka Paar in Barmer, who got married to a Pakistani girl in April 2017 and Vikarm Singh and Nehpal Singh of Baiyaa village in Jaisalmer district, who married Pakistani girls in January 2019, have now requested Union agriculture minister for state Kailash Choudhary for help in procuring a changed visa type from the external affairs ministry.\"We have again approached the Union minister Kailash Choudhary and urged him to help us in getting permission (to travel) via road route. It would be a great help,\u201d said Vikarm, who is hoping to see his newly-born daughter soon.Mahendra Singh Girab, who has been hoping to be joined by his wife for the past four years, told HT he was thankful to the government for considering their cases on humanitarian grounds but at the same time stated that they cannot afford to pay for their wives' travel by the air route.Vikarm told HT that it was minister Kailash Choudhary, whose efforts resulted in the in-principle grant of visas to their wives. \"We have again approached the Union minister and urged him to help us in getting permission to travel via the road route. It would be a great help,\u201d said Vikarm.Choudhary said he had written to the external affairs ministry to take these cases on humanitarian grounds.\"Now the family members have again approached me to arrange them a road route (visa) citing financial reasons. I am trying to help the families in all possible manners,\u201d said Choudhary.27-year-old Nehpal Singh Bhati and his 25-year-old sibling Vikarm Singh Bhati got married across the border in January 2019. After their marriages, both stayed in Pakistan for close to three months before returning to India without their brides, who were denied visas on technical grounds, they claimed.Also Read: Rajasthan police, ATS seize 7 kg heroin in Barmer, arrest suspected drug runnerNehpal was married to the daughter of Ranjeet Singh Sodha on January 22, 2019, while Vikarm wed the daughter of Taneraj Singh Sodha on January 25, 2019.In December, last year, Vikarm\u2019s wife delivered a boy but till this day, he hasn\u2019t been able to see his son in person and has been content catching a glimpse of him on video calls.Mahendra Singh Girab\u2019s wife is from Sinoi village in Amarkot district of Sindh.

This record stood for nine more years until it was broken by the undefeated 2014 Blue Devils, when their show \"Felliniesque\" earned a score of 99.650. Despite this, The Cadets' 2005 championship season remains the only one with a champion to win all captions and sub-captions. Many corps have won all of the overall captions, but only 2005 Cadets won all of the performance and ensemble subcaptions.The Twenty-first Century opened for The Cavaliers much as the Twentieth had ended. The 2001 program of Saucedo's \"Four Corners\" won DCM, was second to Blue Devils at DCI Southwestern in San Antonio, then won DCI Mid-America in Murfreesboro, DCI Midwestern in Indianapolis, and DCI Eastern in Philadelphia. Although they lost several shows to both BD and The Cadets, The Cavaliers took command at the DCI championships in Buffalo, winning Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals for their first consecutive championships since winning the American Legion Nationals in 1966 and '67. 2002 was much like 1961 had been; with an original program of \"Frameworks\" by Richard Saucedo, Bret Kuhn, and Erik Johnson, The Cavaliers won, and they won again and again and again. They won DCM and then won three DCI Regionals, the Southwestern in San Antonio, the Midwestern in Indianapolis, and Drums Along the Rockies in Denver. When The Cavaliers swept through the three rounds at the DCI World Championships in Madison with unheard of score margins of 1.75 to 1.95 points, the corps had not only won a three-peat, but they had earned the second undefeated season in the corps' history. Additionally, the Cavaliers set a world record for highest ever score in DCI history twice: 99.05 in Semifinals and 99.15 in Finals.

    "evidence": "Microsoft is confirming that it is in talks with Chinese company ByteDance to acquire the U. S.  arm of its popular video app TikTok and has discussed with President Donald Trump his concerns about security and censorshipTrump threatens to ban TikTokNEW YORK -- Microsoft confirmed Sunday it is in talks with Chinese company ByteDance to acquire the U. S.  arm of its popular video app TikTok and has discussed with President Donald Trump his concerns about security and censorship surrounding such an acquisition. In a statement, Microsoft said Microsoft and ByteDance have provided notice of their intent to explore a deal resulting in Microsoft owning and operating the TikTok service in the U. S. , Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  The company said it expects those talks to conclude by Sept.  15. Trump said on Friday that he would soon ban TikTok in the United States.  Trump and CEO Satya Nadella have spoken, the company said, and Microsoft was prepared to continue exploring the purchase of TikTok's U. S.  operations after their conversation. \u201cMicrosoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President\u2019s concerns.  It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,\u201d the Microsoft statement said. The White House did not immediately comment on the Microsoft statement. Previously, there were reports that Microsoft was in advanced talks to buy the U. S.  operations of TikTok, which has been a source of national security and censorship concerns for the Trump administration.  Earlier Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again raised the administration's warnings about social media platform. \u201cThese Chinese software companies doing business in the United States, whether it\u2019s TikTok or WeChat \u2014 there are countless more . . .  are feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus,\u201d Pompeo said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures. \u201d\u201cCould be their facial recognition patterns.  It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their friends, who they\u2019re connected to.  Those \u2014 those are the issues that President Trump has made clear we\u2019re going to take care of,\" Pompeo said. In its statement, Microsoft said it may invite other American investors to participate on a minority basis in the purchase of TikTok.  Financial terms were undisclosed. TikTok\u2019s U. S.  user data is stored in the U. S. , with strict controls on employee access, and its biggest investors come from the U. S. , the company said earlier Sunday.  \u201cWe are committed to protecting our users\u2019 privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said. A federal committee has been reviewing whether Trump could ban TikTok in the U. S.  Its members agree that TikTok cannot remain in the U. S.  in its current form because it \"risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. \u201cWe all agree there has to be a change . . .  everybody agrees it can\u2019t exist as it does,\" Mnuchin said Sunday on ABC's \u201cThis Week. \u201dAs speculation grew over a ban or sale of the social media platform's U. S.  business, TikTok posted a video on Saturday saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not planning on going anywhere. \u201dTikTok's catchy videos and ease of use has made it popular, and it says it has tens of millions of users in the U. S.  and hundreds of millions globally.  Its parent company, Bytedance Ltd. , launched TikTok in 2017.  It bought Musical. ly, a video service popular with teens in the U. S.  and Europe, and combined the two.  It has a similar service, Douyin, for users in China. But TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concern about the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials as well as censorship of videos critical of the Chinese government.  TikTok says it does not censor videos and it would not give the Chinese government access to U. S.  user data. \u201cThe President, when he makes his decision, will make sure that everything we have done drives us as close to zero risk for the American people,\u201d Pompeo said.  \u201cThat\u2019s the mission set that he laid out for all of us when we get \u2014 we began to evaluate this now several months back.  We\u2019re closing in on a solution.  And I think you will see the president\u2019s announcement shortly. \u201dThe debate over TikTok parallels a broader U. S.  security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE.  The Trump administration has ordered that the U. S.  stop buying equipment from those providers to be used in U. S.  networks.  Trump has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei over concerns that the Chinese government has access to its data, which Huawei denies. \u2014\u2014\u2014Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter at         www. twitter. com/cbussewitz\u2014\u2014\u2014AP Business Writers Anne D'Innocenzio and Tali Arbel contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.

However , since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip 's older brother , Louis , Duke of Burgundy , could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne , King Charles II of Spain named Philip as his heir in his will . It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe , such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it . Indeed , Philip 's accession in Spain provoked the 14-year War of the Spanish Succession , which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish thrones .

    "claim": "Prussia became part of a state.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Prussia was a historical state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg , and centred on the region of Prussia . For centuries , the House of nocat = y ruled Prussia , successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army . Prussia , with its capital in K\u00f6nigsberg and from 1701 in Berlin , shaped the history of Germany . In 1871 , German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership . In November 1918 , the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918 -- 19 . The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic -- the Free State of Prussia , a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933 . From 1933 , Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup , when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its Gleichschaltung laws in pursuit of a unitary state . With the end of the Nazi regime , the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the -LSB- Oder -- Neisse , nocat = y -RSB- line , which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union , the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945 . Prussia existed de jure until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947 .   The name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians . In the 13th century , the Teutonic Knights -- an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders -- conquered the lands inhabited by them . In 1308 , the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Gda\u0144sk -LRB- Danzig -RRB- . Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany and in the south , it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia . The Second Peace of Thorn -LRB- 1466 -RRB- split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia , a province of Poland , and the eastern part , from 1525 called the Duchy of Prussia , a fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657 . The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 .   Prussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom , and exercised most influence in the 18th and 19th centuries . During the 18th century it had a major say in many international affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great . During the 19th century , Chancellor Otto von Bismarck united the German principalities into a `` Lesser Germany '' which excluded the Austrian Empire .   At the Congress of Vienna -LRB- 1814 -- 15 -RRB- , which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon 's defeat , Prussia acquired a large section of north western Germany , including the coal-rich Ruhr . The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically , and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867 , and then of the German Empire in 1871 . The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that -LSB- Junker -LRB- Prussia -RRB- , Junker -RSB- s and other Prussian \u00e9lites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians .   The Kingdom ended in 1918 . In the Weimar Republic , the state of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen . East Prussia lost all of its German population after 1945 , as Poland and the Soviet Union absorbed its territory and expelled most of its inhabitants .   The term Prussian has often been used , especially outside of Germany , to emphasise the professionalism , aggressiveness , militarism and conservatism of the Junker class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire .

Claim: Videos shows Indian soldiers injured in an attack by Pakistan army. Fact: The video is related to a road accident in Meghalaya.  The BSF jawans in the video got injured as the bus fell into a gorge.  The accident has no connection with any attack by the Pakistan army.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the screenshots of the video were run through the Google Reverse Image Search, many news articles with similar visuals were found in the search results.  According to an article published by \u2018Northeast Now\u2019, the jawans in the video suffered injuries when the \u2018bus carrying 20 BSF jawans fell into a deep gorge\u2019.  Talking to \u2018Northeast Now\u2019, Lakador Syiem (SP, East Jaintia Hills) said, \u2018At around 4:30 PM, an overspeeding bus with registration No.  AS-05C-2034 went off-road and fell in a gorge (approx 100 ft) at Umtyraa in East Jaintia Hills. \u2019 The same news can also be read here and here.

    "evidence": "Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco , California . It develops , hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app , which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses , as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24 . The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews , hosts social events for reviewers , and provides data about businesses , including health inspection scores .   Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman . Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding . By 2010 it had $ 30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews . From 2009 to 2012 , Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia . In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition . Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later . As of 2016 , Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews . The company 's revenues come from businesses advertising .   According to BusinessWeek , Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses . Criticism of Yelp focuses on the legitimacy of reviews , public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending , as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers . , Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia . Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . The eastern boundary with Asia is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them ; Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas , and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe -- a concept dating back to classical antiquity -- are arbitrary . The primarily physiographic term `` continent '' as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent 's current overland boundaries .   Europe covers about 10,180,000 km2 , or 2 % of the Earth 's surface -LRB- 6.8 % of land area -RRB- . Politically , Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population .  Europe had a total population of about 740 million -LRB- about 11 % of world population -RRB- .   The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the sea , seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast .   Europe , in particular ancient Greece , was the birthplace of Western civilization . The fall of the Western Roman Empire , during the migration period , marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages . Renaissance humanism , exploration , art , and science led to the modern era . From the Age of Discovery onwards , Europe played a predominant role in global affairs . Between the 16th and 20th centuries , European powers controlled at various times the Americas , most of Africa , Oceania , and the majority of Asia .   The Industrial Revolution , which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century , gave rise to radical economic , cultural , and social change in Western Europe , and eventually the wider world . Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe , contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence . During the Cold War , Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east , until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall .   In 1955 , the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill , with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals . It includes all states except for Belarus , Kazakhstan and Vatican City . Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union , a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation . The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The currency of most countries of the European Union , the euro , is the most commonly used among Europeans ; and the EU 's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states . The European Anthem is `` Ode to Joy '' and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Steven Patrick Morrissey -LRB- born 22 May 1959 -RRB- , professionally known as Morrissey , is an English singer , songwriter and author . He rose to prominence as the lead singer of the indie rock band the Smiths , which was active from 1982 to 1987 . Since then , Morrissey has had a solo career , making the top ten of the UK Singles Chart on ten occasions .   Born in Davyhulme , Lancashire , to a working-class Irish migrant family , Morrissey grew up in Manchester . As a child he developed a love of literature , kitchen sink realism and popular music . Involved in Manchester 's punk rock scene during the late 1970s , he fronted the Nosebleeds , with little success . Beginning a career in music journalism , he authored a number of books on music and film in the early 1980s . With Johnny Marr he established the Smiths in 1982 , soon attracting national recognition for their self-titled debut album . As the band 's frontman , Morrissey attracted attention both for his witty and sardonic lyrics and his idiosyncratic appearance ; deliberately avoiding rock machismo , he cultivated the aesthetic of a social outsider who eschewed drugs and embraced celibacy . He was also noted for his unusual baritone vocal style -LRB- though he sometimes uses falsetto -RRB- , The Smiths released five further albums -- including the critically acclaimed Meat is Murder and The Queen is Dead -- and had a string of hit singles . Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in The Smiths ' separation in 1987 .   In 1988 , Morrissey launched his solo career with the album Viva Hate . This and its follow-up albums -- Bona Drag , Kill Uncle , Your Arsenal , and Vauxhall and I -- all did well in the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles . Having left Britain and moved to Los Angeles , during the mid-1990s Morrissey 's image began to shift into that of a burlier figure , who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity . In the mid-to-late 1990s , his subsequent albums , Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted , also charted but were less well received . After a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 , Morrissey released a successful comeback album , You Are the Quarry , in 2004 . Relocating to Italy , ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors , Years of Refusal , and World Peace Is None of Your Business . In 2013 Morrissey released his autobiography , followed by his first novel in 2015 .   Highly influential , Morrissey is widely credited as being a seminal figure in the emergence of indie rock and Britpop . He has been acclaimed as one of the greatest lyricists in British history , with his lyrics having become the subject of academic study . He has courted controversy with his forthright opinions -- endorsing vegetarianism and animal rights , condemning royalty and prominent politicians , and questioning issues of British national and cultural identity . In a 2006 poll held by the BBC 's Culture Show , Morrissey was voted the second greatest living British cultural icon . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": " In June 2021, a rumor was circulated on social media that the Walt Disney Company was attempting to copyright or trademark various characters from Norse mythology, such as Loki and Thor, that have become popular due to the \u201cAvengers\u201d movies and television shows.  This rumor stems from an incident involving a piece of \u201cLow Key Loki\u201d merchandise that was pulled from Redbubble, an online marketplace for artists.  Twitter user YourBoswell posted an image of the letter they received after their \u201cLow Key Loki\u201d product was taken down: As this letter went viral, many social media users claimed that Disney was trying to take ownership of Norse mythology and other gods in the public domain. \u00a0   A few things to note right away.  First, Disney did not file a complaint against this specific Redbubble product.  If you read the letter above, it notes that Redbubble decided this product violated another company\u2019s copyright and they took a preemptive step to have it removed. \u00a0 More importantly though, Disney is not attempting to take ownership of Norse gods.  Ancient stories and depictions of Loki are still in the public domain.  Here, for example, is a depiction of Loki from the 18th century.  Disney does not own the following image and has no claim of ownership to it. \u00a0 The company can, however, claim ownership of the version of Loki that it created. \u00a0 The Redbubble mentioned above, for instance, didn\u2019t run afoul of Disney\u2019s copyright simply because it had to do with a Norse god.  This product was removed because it closely resembled a specific outfit that Loki wears \u2014 a shirt bearing the words \u201cLow Key\u201d \u2014 in the pages of a 2019 Marvel comic.  Low.  Key.   Our best-dressed heroes of the month: https://t. co/pKxwwVF2dM pic. twitter. com/4nUp16ednu \u2014 Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) August 27, 2019 The version on Red Bubble had a slightly different design (the coloring of the \u201cLow Key\u201d text on the Redbubble version was green), but Redbubble felt that it was too close to Disney\u2019s depiction of Loki and had it removed. \u00a0 Disney does not own copyrights or trademarks (and we\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that it is trying to obtain them) on public domain heroes such as Thor and Loki.  The company does, however, have ownership of the versions of these characters that it creates.  If someone makes a piece of art that resembles the versions of Thor or Loki in the Marvel universe, the company could claim that those artworks violated its intellectual property.  If someone wants to create unique versions of these characters, however, they would be in their rights to do so, as these are in the public domain. \u00a0 Here, for example, is a trailer for a movie called \u201cAlmighty Thor\u201d that was released in 2011 around the same time that Disney released \u201cThor. \u201d As the \u201cAlmighty Thor\u201d was based on public domain characters from Norse mythology, and not from any specific versions of these characters created by Marvel or Disney, the \u201cAlmighty Thor\u201d did not violate the intellectual property of those companies.

Early in his career , he also produced a temperance novel , Franklin Evans -LRB- 1842 -RRB- . Whitman 's major work , Leaves of Grass , was first published in 1855 with his own money .

The Rajasthan government had even said that Bhilwara Model can be tweaked to contain the spread of the disease in other hotspots. But now, the city is battling a surge in infection after a family invited more than 50 guests in a marriage function despite the restrictions in place.  The function was organised by Ghisulal Rathi, a resident of Bhadada Mohalla, for his son\u2019s marriage on June 13. After the event, 15 guests tested positive for Covid-19 while one died of the disease, District Collector Rajendra Bhatt said.  A case was registered against Rathi in this regard on June 22, he added. \u201cThe state government incurred a loss of Rs 6,26,600 for arranging isolation and quarantine facility, testing, food, ambulance for these guests.  To recover the said amount, the family has been asked to deposit the money in the CM Relief Fund,\u201d said Bhatt. Bhilwara was among the 10 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots in the country, but the ruthless containment model helped it check the spread of the diease.  The state had even received praise from cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba for successfully implementing the model. The Bhilwara model of containment worked in phases.  The first task was to isolate the district, second was screening strategy in city and rural areas and third was quarantine and isolation wards, followed by monitoring mechanism for rural areas, according to government officials. Discussing the success of the model, Rajasthan\u2019s additional chief secretary of medical and health department Rohit Kumar Singh had told Hindustan Times in April, \u201cThe Bhilwara model is a typical containment strategy.  It starts with lockdown, and lockdown means lockdown - no movement, no exemptions.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations , the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; there are now 193 . The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan , New York City , and experiences extraterritoriality . Further main offices are situated in Geneva , Nairobi , and Vienna . The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states . Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security , promoting human rights , fostering social and economic development , protecting the environment , and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine , natural disaster , and armed conflict . The UN is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organisation in the world .   The UN Charter was drafted at a conference between April -- June 1945 in San Francisco , and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference ; this charter took effect 24 October 1945 , and the UN began operation . The UN 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies . The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo , as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 . The organization 's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s , and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping . After the end of the Cold War , the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success .   The UN has six principal organs : the General Assembly -LRB- the main deliberative assembly -RRB- ; the Security Council -LRB- for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security -RRB- ; the Economic and Social Council -LRB- ECOSOC ; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development -RRB- ; the Secretariat -LRB- for providing studies , information , and facilities needed by the UN -RRB- ; the International Court of Justice -LRB- the primary judicial organ -RRB- ; and the UN Trusteeship Council -LRB- inactive since 1994 -RRB- . UN System agencies include the World Bank Group , the World Health Organization , the World Food Programme , UNESCO , and UNICEF . The UN 's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General , an office held by Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio Guterres since 2017 . Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN 's work .   The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 , and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize . Other evaluations of the UN 's effectiveness have been mixed . Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development , while others have called the organization ineffective , corrupt , or biased . ",

She is also known for playing Sheriff Jody Mills on \"Supernatural\".The twins attended Buckner Middle School during seasons 1 & 2, Cheevers High School during season 3 of \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", and then Seven Seas High on board the SS \"Tipton\" in \"The Suite Life on Deck\". Cody is more erudite, mature and intelligent than Zack. Cody tends to be more sensitive, caring and better behaved than his brother, but he is not perfect; he occasionally shows acts of meanness and greed. He generally receives good grades in school, and according to Zack, Cody has a 5.0 grade point average. He is often referred to as a nerd, though he prefers \"educationally gifted\". London Tipton, daughter of the man who owns the Tipton Hotel in which he resides for the duration of \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", uses him on various occasions to complete her school work. In one episode of \"The Suite Life on Deck\", Cody and Zack fight over the fact that Zack stole an old term paper from Cody rather than writing his own, and Zack admits that he knows he'll never match Cody academically and feels inferior to his brother; in response, Cody admits that he works hard to get grades because Zack is better at sports, better with girls, and more popular, while the only thing Cody has going for him is his intelligence. He is shown to have a strong, almost obsessive, fear of germs. Despite his exceptional intelligence and relative maturity when compared to Zack, Cody exhibits some comically regressive behaviors, such as calling his mother \"Mommy\", screaming girlishly when frightened, and carrying a \"blankey\" into his teens. This becomes a running joke throughout the series. In \"Big Hair & Baseball\", it is revealed that he has astigmatism. Cody is proven to have a Swedish background in the \"Suite Life on Deck\" episode \"The Swede Life\". He originally intended to attend Harvard University; however, he has a bad encounter with a Dean there, as he helped to lie when Zack dated the Dean's daughter. Later on, he decides to attend Yale. Cody says that his biggest dream is to win a Nobel Prize.",

Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Photo of an AAP campaign banner in Gujarat which reads \u2013 \u2018Gujarat will read namaz\u2019. Fact: The posted photo is an edited one.  On comparing with the other similar banners, it can be seen that the text \u2013 \u2018Now Gujarat will change\u2019 (in Gujarati) has been replaced with \u2018Gujarat will read namaz\u2019, and the empty space has been filled with the text \u2013 \u2018Bhagwat saptah aur Satyanarayan katha/puja jaisi faltu pratha chhodo\u2019.  Also, the photo of Gopal Italia (President, Aam Aadmi Party \u2013 Gujarat) on the posted banner has been edited.  Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the posted photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that \u2018AAP Gujarat\u2019 has already clarified that the viral photo is fake as it has been edited.  Yogesh Jadvani, a spokesperson of AAP Gujarat, has tweeted the original poster design on his account after the edited image went viral.  It can be seen that the text \u2013 \u2018Now Gujarat will change\u2019 (in Gujarati) has been replaced with \u2018Gujarat will read namaz\u2019, and the empty space has been filled with the text \u2013 \u2018Bhagwat saptah aur Satyanarayan katha/puja jaisi faltu pratha chhodo\u2019. Except for the posted viral photo (which has been edited), none of the other similar banner photos on social media had such religious hate text as claimed in the post.  Some of the banners from various other locations can be seen here, here, here, and here.  It can also be noticed that the photo of Gopal Italia (President, Aam Aadmi Party \u2013 Gujarat) on the posted banner has been edited (with the photo of Mullah Krekar).

In traditional opera , singers do two types of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style and arias , a more melodic style , in which notes are sung in a sustained fashion . Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre , such as acting , scenery , and costumes and sometimes includes dance . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor .   Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition . It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century -LRB- with Jacopo Peri 's mostly lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 -RRB- and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Heinrich Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Jean-Baptiste Lully in France , and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe -LRB- except France -RRB- , attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his `` reform '' operas in the 1760s . In the 2000s , the most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro -LRB- Le nozze di Figaro -RRB- , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as The Magic Flute -LRB- Die Zauberfl\u00f6te -RRB- , a landmark in the German tradition .   The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Gioachino Rossini , Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating works that are still performed . It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer . The mid-to-late 19th century was a `` golden age '' of opera , led and dominated by Richard Wagner in Germany and Giuseppe Verdi in Italy . The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century . During the 19th century , parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe , particularly in Russia and Bohemia . The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles , such as atonality and serialism -LRB- Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg -RRB- , Neoclassicism -LRB- Igor Stravinsky -RRB- , and Minimalism -LRB- Philip Glass and John Adams -RRB- . With the rise of recording technology , singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans . Since the invention of radio and television , operas were also performed on -LRB- and written for -RRB- these mediums . Beginning in 2006 , a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world . In 2009 , an opera company offered an online download of a complete performance . ",

    "evidence": "The outrage machinery went into operation soon after Kashmiri photographers, Dar Yasin, Mukhtar Khan and Channi Anand were honoured with the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in feature photography for their coverage of Kashmir.  Predictably, they began discrediting the award.  Right-wing propaganda website OpIndia published an article titled, \u201cJoseph Pulitzer \u2013 the story of the founder of the Pulitzer Prizes, and the Father of Yellow Journalism\u201d where it argued that \u201cThe \u201cOscar\u201d of journalism is named after a man who arguably laid the foundation for what would be known later as \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, a sensationalist press that is the predecessor to today\u2019s tabloid news and fake news phenomenon\u201d. The \u201cOscar\u201d of journalism is named after a man who arguably laid the foundation for what would be known later as \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, a sensationalist press that is the predecessor to today\u2019s tabloid news and fake news phenomenonhttps://t. co/7vpyUkIukI\u2014 OpIndia. com (@OpIndia_com) May 6, 2020Alt News found that not just the above-stated quote which forms the basis for OpIndia\u2019s article, but the entire article is heavily plagiarised from multiple sources and infringes on copyright violation.  This was first pointed out by Twitter user @kundansonu. Plagiarism or presenting someone else\u2019s work as your own is considered \u201cone of the primary sins of journalism\u201d.  The rules are simple \u2013 passages copied exactly from others should be put in quotation marks and attributed to the source. The Opindia article replicates entire passages verbatim from at least two sources without crediting them.  Alt News checked the article using the tool \u2018Copyscape\u2019 and found several glaring instances where entire passages were presented as their own work. 1.  Vintage NewsOpIndia has copied verbatim 135 words or 13% of the text from the website, Vintage News. \nShockingly, this includes the quote \u2013 \u201cThe \u201cOscar\u201d of journalism is named after a man who arguably laid the foundation for what would be known later as \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, a sensationalist press that is the predecessor to today\u2019s tabloid news and fake news phenomenon\u201d \u2013 that is used in OpIndia\u2019s tweet as well as the subheading of the article. \n\nBelow is a screenshot of the portions directly copied from Vintage News.  On the left are excerpts from OpIndia\u2019s story and on the right are passages from Vintage News. \n2.  US State Department42% of the text, i. e. , 436 words out of the 1050 word article were copied from a single source, which is the US Department of state archive. \nThe same content is also available on the Department of State, Office of the Historian website.  OpIndia has copied entire passages without using quotation marks. \n\n\nInstead of crediting the original source i. e.  the US State Department, from which 42% of the text is copied, OpIndia credits History. com website of A&E Networks which has 149 words or 14% matching text, also sourced from the State Department. The terms of service of Vintage News clearly states that all content on the website is protected by copyright. \nThe copyright information on the US State Department reads, \u201cUnless a copyright is indicated, information on the State Department\u2019s main website is in the public domain and may be copied and distributed without permission.  Citation of the US State Department as source of the information is appreciated. \u201dIt must be pointed out that while there is no legal requirement to give credit to content that is sourced from the public domain, content from public domain if passed off as own piece of work, still falls under the definition of plagiarism.  As explained in Stanford Copyright and Fair use guidelines, \u201cWhen copying works from the public domain, be careful to avoid plagiarism.  Plagiarism occurs when someone poses as the originator of words he did not write, ideas he did not conceive, or facts he did not discover. \u201dIt is ironical that an article written to criticize the Pulitzer prize and point out its origins in sensationalist yellow journalism turns out to be heavily plagiarized.  Nearly half of the article is identical to the US Department of State open-source content but is not credited.  The main argument of OpIndia\u2019s piece, which is also the subheading, is lifted from another website.  With random bits replicated in entirety from internet sources, this is an example of \u2018copy-paste journalism\u2019 at its worst.  Numerous plagiarism detection tools are available on the internet yet, copied content makes its way to published articles.  In the past Alt News had found shocking instances of plagiarism in the publications of a premier right-wing think tank, India Foundation.

The decision to rename the Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra and Foreign Service Institute, both located in New Delhi, was made on the eve of Swaraj\u2019s birth anniversary on February 14.  Swaraj, India\u2019s first full-time woman foreign minister, died of cardiac arrest on 6 August 2019.  She was 67. In a statement, the external affairs ministry said the renaming of the Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra as Sushma Swaraj Bhawan and Foreign Service Institute as Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service was intended to commemorate her invaluable contribution to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service. \u201cThe announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on 14th February in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former external affairs minister,\u201d the statement said. Swaraj extended a helping hand to many Indians in distress abroad and acquired a reputation as one of the most accessible ministers in the first term of the Narendra Modi government.  She died months after she was replaced by S Jaishankar in the second Modi government. The Pravasi Bhartiya Kendra was established as the focal point for networking between India and the overseas Indian community, and as a suitable place to commemorate the trials, tribulations, evolution and achievements of the Indian diaspora. The announcement about the setting up of the Kendra was made at the second Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) in New Delhi by the then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and its foundation stone was laid by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh during the 9th PBD in January 2011.  It is used to organise activities, seminars, events and workshops pertaining to the Indian diaspora. The Foreign Service Institute (FSI), established in 1986 by the external affairs ministry, is one of the premier training organisations for diplomats in the region.  Besides handling the professional training needs of Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers, the FSI also runs training programmes for mid-career officers, commercial representatives and defence attaches posted in Indian missions abroad, members of other civil services, and foreign diplomats as a way to build bridges of friendship and cooperation with other countries.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field , at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket -LRB- a set of three wooden stumps -RRB- at each end . One team bats , attempting to score as many runs as possible , whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a fixed number of overs have been completed , the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles . The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their innings .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards the wicket at that end , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker `` takes guard '' on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket . His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by use of his bat , and simultaneously to strike it well enough to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler . A dismissed batsman must leave the field , and a teammate replaces him . The bowler 's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman . An over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same bowler . The next over is bowled from the other end of the pitch by a different bowler .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball ; leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat ; and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored by two main methods : either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the boundary , or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder retrieves the ball quickly enough to put down the wicket with a batsman not having reached the crease at that end of the pitch , that batsman is dismissed -LRB- a run-out occurs -RRB- . Adjudication is performed on the field by two umpires .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council -LRB- ICC -RRB- and the Marylebone Cricket Club -LRB- MCC -RRB- . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs -LRB- i.e. 120 deliveries -RRB- , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit , but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball , which is a hard , solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . The sport is followed primarily in Australasia , Britain , the Indian subcontinent , southern Africa and the West Indies . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard . ",

    "evidence": "UK has shot past its 100,000 daily coronavirus tests target set for the end of April with 122,347 testing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on Friday.Addressing the daily Downing Street briefing, the senior minister hailed the \u201caudacious\u201d testing goal being met by a coordinated team effort as he revealed a further 739 deaths from Covid-19, taking the country\u2019s toll from the pandemic to 27,510.\u201cAt the beginning of last month, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test. That as a nation we should achieve 100,000 per day by the end of the month,\u201d Hancock said.\u201cI knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important. I can announce we have met our goal. This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement,\u201d he said.The criteria set by the government for people accessing coronavirus tests cover over 25 million National Health Service (NHS) staff on the frontlines of the pandemic, key workers and others who need to leave the house to go to their job.Hancock said that testing will form the basis \u201cfor getting Britain back on her feet\u201d and the easing of the lockdown in place to keep a lid on the rate of infection, referred to as R, with work underway to recruit the 18,00 contact tracers to keep track of the deadly virus.\u201cPeople will be able to know if they had been in contact with someone with the disease. This will drive the infection rate down. It will get R down and hold R down,\u201d he said.Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, joined the Cabinet minister as the UK\u2019s national coronavirus testing coordinator and declared that the country had succeeded in putting in place world-leading testing facilities.\u201cWe now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country,\u201d he said.It was claimed that the latest data from hospitals and across the wider community reflects \u201creal progress\u201d as the number of infections is falling.The officials revealed that hospital admissions, particularly in London which was way ahead in terms of the infection than other parts of Britain, is continuing a downward trend and the number of people in critical care is also falling across the board.

    "evidence": "Devprayag is the home of priests of Badrinath. They are known as \"Pandas\". Every Panda has his own region in whole country. A thousand years ago, when Adiguru Shankaracharya came to the area in Badrikashram in the 8th century, many South Indian Brahmins from different areas with different castes came to Devprayag with Aadiguru. These were \"Tetriya Krishna Yajur Brahmin\". Inspired by the wisdom of the Brahmins, the Maharaja of Garhwal assigned them to worship Lord Ram in Raghunath Temple in Devprayag. When these Brahmins arrived at Badrinath, they were worshiped by the pilgrims. Since then, these Brahmins are known as Panda in Dham and everywhere. Pandas worship devotees of the same area of each region they offers. Every Panda plays a significant role in the life of devotees, referred to as Y\u00e1tris, who arrive in Badrinath for Puja or Darshan. While in Badrinath, Pandas look after them very carefully. Pandas organize everything for their Yatri like food, accommodation, puja's tickets, and everything which is really needful to the yatri. Pandas have thousands of years of literature of their devotees. This literature is purported to have information about the devotee's last 3 or 4 generations. Every Panda has various types of books related to his Yatri's information, like Bahi, Daskhati and all others. Every Yatri is identified with the help of these books. The peoples of Devprayag (Pandas) spend their 6 months of a year at Badrinath and rest of 2\u20133 months in Devprayag. They spend this in their own regions. It is quite hard for a Panda and his family as He spends very less time with the family. Many peoples say that Pandagiri is a very normal and less prestigious occupation. But as it belongs to their God Almighty and this is their patrimonial occupation, it automatically becomes more prestigious rather than the other occupations. The cuisines of Devprayag are also rich and famous as Devprayag. Dishes like Singori and Bal Mithai keep an important place in Devprayagi's heart. Singori, traditionally made with khoya wrapped in form of a cone with Maalu leaves. The khoya absorbs the smell of Maalu leaves. On the other hand, Bal Mithai is a brown chocolate-like fudge, made with roasted khoya, coated with white sugar balls.",

It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east , and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the \u00d6resund . At 450295 km2 , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area , with a total population of 10.0 million . Sweden consequently has a low population density of 22 PD/km2 , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country . Approximately 85 % of the population lives in urban areas .   Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times , emerging into history as the Geats/G \u00f6tar and Swedes/Svear and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen . Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural , while the north is heavily forested . Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia . The climate is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence , that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers . Today , Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy , with a monarch as head of state . The capital city is Stockholm , which is also the most populous city in the country . Legislative power is vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag . Executive power is exercised by the government chaired by the prime minister . Sweden is a unitary state , currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities .   Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages . In the 17th century , it expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire , which became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century . Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries , ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809 . The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 , when Norway was militarily forced into personal union . Since then , Sweden has been at peace , maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs . The union with Norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905 , leading to Sweden 's current borders . Though Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars , Sweden engaged in humanitarian efforts , such as taking in refugees from German-occupied Europe .   After the end of the Cold War , Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 , but declined NATO membership , as well as Eurozone membership following a referendum . It is also a member of the United Nations , the Nordic Council , Council of Europe , the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- . Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens . It has the world 's eighth-highest per capita income and ranks highly in numerous metrics of national performance , including quality of life , health , education , protection of civil liberties , economic competitiveness , equality , prosperity and human development .

It is the fourth-most populous city in Australia , with an estimated population of 2.06 million living in Greater Perth . Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia , with the majority of the metropolitan area located on the Swan Coastal Plain , a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The first areas settled were on the Swan River , with the city 's central business district and port -LRB- Fremantle -RRB- both located on its shores .   Perth was founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . It gained city status -LRB- currently vested in the smaller City of Perth -RRB- in 1856 , and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929 . The city is named after Perth , Scotland , due to the influence of Sir George Murray , Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies . The city 's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century . During Australia 's involvement in World War II , Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre , and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay . An influx of immigrants after the war , predominantly from Britain , Greece , Italy and Yugoslavia , led to rapid population growth . This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for a number of large mining operations located around the state .   As part of Perth 's role as the capital of Western Australia , the state 's Parliament and Supreme Court are located within the city , as is Government House , the residence of the Governor of Western Australia . Perth came seventh in the Economist Intelligence Unit 's August 2016 list of the world 's most liveable cities , and was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2010 as a world city .   Perth is divided into 30 local government areas and 250 suburbs , stretching from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south , and east inland to The Lake . Outside of the main CBD , important urban centres within Perth include Armadale , Fremantle , Joondalup , Midland , and Rockingham . Most of those were originally established as separate settlements , and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area . Mandurah , Western Australia 's second-largest city , has in recent years formed a conurbation with Perth along the coast , though for most purposes it is still considered a separate city . , Australia -LRB- -LSB- \u0259\u02c8stre\u026ali\u0259 -RSB- , -LSB- \u0252 - -RSB- , -LSB- - lj\u0259 -RSB- -RRB- , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands . It is the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea , Indonesia and East Timor to the north ; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east ; and New Zealand to the south-east . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest urban area is Sydney .   For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century , Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians ,  who spoke languages classifiable into roughly 250 groups . After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories . The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard .   Australia has the world 's 13th-largest economy and ninth-highest per capita income -LRB- IMF -RRB- . With the second-highest human development index globally , the country ranks highly in quality of life , health , education , economic freedom , and civil liberties and political rights . Australia is a member of the United Nations , G20 , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- , World Trade Organization , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , and the Pacific Islands Forum .

    "evidence": "Biden remembered those who were killed and called for unity going forward. Senate votes to acquit former President Donald TrumpFormer President Donald Trump's historic second impeachment trial ended with a 57-43 vote to acquit in the Senate.  He faced a single charge of incitement of insurrection over his actions leading up to the Jan.  6 riot at the U. S.  Capitol. In his first comments on the acquittal of his predecessor, nearly seven hours after the vote, President Joe Biden opened by remembering late officer Brian Sicknick and praised his fellow police officers for defending the Capitol on Jan.  6. He then took a tone similar to the House impeachment managers following the 57-43 vote -- short of the 67 needed to convict former President Donald Trump -- by celebrating a bipartisan vote. \"Today, 57 Senators -- including a record 7 Republicans -- voted to find former President Trump guilty for inciting that deadly insurrection on our very democracy,\" Biden said in the statement.  \"The Senate vote followed the bipartisan vote to impeach him by the House of Representatives.  While the final vote did not lead to a conviction, the substance of the charge is not in dispute. \"Biden highlighted the speech by Sen.  Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , that angered some Democrats for its acknowledgement of incitement and acquittal vote on a technicality. \"Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a 'disgraceful dereliction of duty' and 'practically and morally responsible for provoking' the violence unleashed on the Capitol,\" the president added. Biden, who largely avoided commenting on the impeachment trial in favor of promoting his agenda on COVID-19 relief, thanked those \"who bravely stood guard that January day\" and \"those who demonstrated the courage to protect the integrity of our democracy. \"\"This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile,\" Biden wrote.  \"That it must always be defended.  That we must be ever vigilant.  That violence and extremism has no place in America.  And that each of us has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders, to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. \"\"That is how we end this uncivil war and heal the very soul of our nation.  That is the task ahead.  And it\u2019s a task we must undertake together.  As the United States of America,\" he concluded, underlining \"United\" for emphasis. Literally minutes after Sen.  Bill Cassidy, R-La. , voted to convict President Donald Trump the Louisiana GOP voted to censure him.  Cassidy was one of seven Republicans to cross party lines. \"The Executive Committee of the Republican Party of Louisiana has unanimously voted to censure Senator Bill Cassidy for his vote cast earlier today to convict former President Donald J.  Trump on the impeachment charge,\" the Republican Party of Louisiana said in a statement. Cassidy, who vacillated between convicting and acquitting the president this week, has been a senator since 2014.  He was previously a congressman from the state.  A censure officially condemns a politician, but does not carry any further power, such as removal from office. \"Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person,\" Cassidy said in a statement.  \"I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty. \"-ABC News' Quinn ScanlanHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , said she wasn't planning on speaking Saturday but did so after she saw Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , speak on the Senate floor. \"It is so pathetic that Senator McConnell kept the Senate shut down so that the Senate could not receive the Article of Impeachment and has used that as his excuse for not voting to convict Donald Trump,\" Pelosi said. \"What we saw in that Senate today was a cowardly group of Republicans who apparently have no options, because they were afraid to defend their job, respect the institution in which they serve,\" Pelosi said. Asked about McConnell's statement on the floor suggesting that Trump still was liable criminally or civilly for his actions in office, Pelosi interrupted the reporter and said his speech was \"disingenuous. \"\"I don't know whether it was for donors or -- or what.  But whatever it was, it was a very disingenuous speech.  And I say that regretfully, because I always want to be able to work -- work with the leadership of the other party,\" she said.  \"And for him to have tried to have it every which way -- but we will be going forward to make sure that this never happens again. \"Asked about censure as an option moving forward, Pelosi called it a \"slap in the fact of the Constitution\" and said it, \"let's everybody off the hook. \"\"We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol,\" she said. Pelosi went on to congratulate the House managers on honoring the vision of the founders, of the men and women who serve in uniform and families across the United States, including her own. \"I have to say, personally on behalf of my grandchildren, who drew great hope and inspiration from each and every one of you: We could not be prouder of your patriotic presentations, the clarity in which you presented, and again, the inspiration that you have been to so many people,\" she said. Raising the vote to convict was the most bipartisan in impeachment trial history, she said, \"It would not have been accomplished without your brilliant presentations.  So, I\u00a0thank you for that, and I yield the floor back to all of you as I leave. \"House impeachment managers, following the Senate vote to acquit Trump, held a press conference on Capitol Hill and harped on remarks from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , saying that they proved the case that Trump incited an insurrection despite failing to reach the votes needed to convict. Lead House impeachment manager Rep.  Jamie Raskin, D-Md. , opened by thanking Congress, his team and the American people. \"Trump stormed our House with the mob he incited, and we defended our House.  And he violated our Constitution, and we defended the Constitution.  And they tried to trash our democracy, and we revived it, and we protected it,\" Raskin began, highlighting that the trial was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in the history of the country. \"We have a clear and convincing majority of members of Congress that the president actually incited violent insurrection against the union and against the Congress,\" Raskin said. He went on to explain that because House managers had convinced McConnell -- although they didn't get his vote -- that they made their case and didn't see a need to call witnesses after all. \"We could have had 5,000 witnesses and Mitch McConnell would have made the same speech because what he's asserting is that the Senate never has jurisdiction over a former president,\" Raskin said.  \"And for reasons I don't need to belabor -- because a big part of the trial was about this -- we reject that completely.  It's totally at odds with our history. \"",

    "evidence": "Former union minister Subodh Kant Sahay will be the Congress\u2019s Lok Sabha candidate from Ranchi, while the party\u2019s former state unit president and MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat will contest from Lohardaga and Jagannathpur legislator Gita Koda, wife of ex-chief minister Madhu Koda, will enter the fray from the Singhbhum Lok Sabha constituency, the Jharkhand Congress chapter announced early Wednesday.  As part of the grand opposition alliance, the Congress has been allotted 7 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand.  The party is yet to announce candidates for the other four seats in Hazaribagh, Dhanbad, Khunti and Chatra, the constituency which will be the first to go to polls on April 29. Persons familiar with developments within the Congress said that with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) adamant on fielding Subhash Yadav - former CM Lalu Prasad\u2019s brother-in-law - from Chatra, the Congress could ultimately leave the seat to that party.  \u201cOtherwise it could lead to more \u2018friendly fights\u2019 in other constituencies that would defeat the very purpose of the grand alliance,\u201d said a senior party leader. However, the spokesman of the Jharkhand chapter of the Congress, Kishore Nath Shahdeo, insisted that his party will field a candidate from Chatra.  \u201cThe last date for withdrawal of nominations for Chatra is April 12.  We are confident that we will be able to convince the RJD to withdraw their candidature,\u201d he said.  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, is yet to announce names for three constituencies including Ranchi but Congress\u2019s Ranchi candidate, Subodh Kant Sahay, said he was not worried about whom the saffron party will field against him. \u201cI don\u2019t prepare for an election in 15-20 days, it is an ongoing process for me,\u201d said Sahay, who also held a meeting with JMM President Shibu Soren and leader of the opposition, Hemant Soren on Wednesday.  \u201cAnybody is welcome. \u201dSahay, who will fight under the slogan \u2018Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan\u2019, said that he will make people aware about the \u2018failures\u2019 of the Modi government and how it wasted five years in office in \u2018pitching communities against each other\u2019. \u201cAll they did was demolish the social fabric of the country.

    "evidence": "The musical film is a film genre in which songs sung by the characters are interwoven into the narrative , sometimes accompanied by dancing .   The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film 's characters , though in some cases they serve merely as breaks in the storyline , often as elaborate `` production numbers '' .   The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology . Typically , the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be impractical in a theater . Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater ; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if there is a live audience watching . In a sense , the viewer becomes the diegetic audience , as the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it . , Moana -LRB- -LSB- mo\u028a\u02c8\u0251\u02d0n\u0259 -RSB- -RRB- is a 2016 American computer-animated musical fantasy-adventure film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . It is the 56th Disney animated feature film . Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker , co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams , the film introduces Auli'i Cravalho as Moana and features the voices of Dwayne Johnson , Rachel House , Temuera Morrison , Jemaine Clement , Nicole Scherzinger , and Alan Tudyk . The film features music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda , Opetaia Foa'i , and Mark Mancina .   The film tells the story of Moana , the strong-willed daughter of the chief of a Polynesian tribe , who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with a goddess . When a blight strikes her island , Moana sets sail in search of Maui , a legendary demigod , in the hope of saving her people .   Moana was released theatrically in the United States on November 23 , 2016 to critical acclaim , with critics particularly praising the film for its animation , music , and voice cast . The film went on to gross over $ 642 million worldwide . Along with Zootopia , it marked the first time since 2002 that Walt Disney Animation Studios released two feature films in the same year . It received two Academy Award nominations at the 89th Academy Awards : one for Best Animated Feature and another for Best Original Song -LRB- `` How Far I 'll Go '' -RRB- . ",

The series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character , as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe . Although Oliver Queen/Green Arrow had been featured in the television series Smallville from 2006 to 2011 , on the CW , the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character . Arrow focuses on the humanity of Oliver Queen , and how he was changed by time spent shipwrecked on an island . Most episodes in the first five seasons have flashback scenes to the five years in which Oliver was missing .   Arrow has received generally positive reviews from critics . The series averaged about 3.68 million viewers over the course of the first season and received several awards and multiple nominations . To promote it , a preview comic book was released before the television series began , while webisodes featuring a product tie-in with Bose were developed for the second season .

Despite being primarily a football club , Santos compete in a number of different sports , including American football , surfing , and even eSports . It plays in the Paulist\u00e3o , the State of S\u00e3o Paulo 's premier state league , as well as the Brasileir\u00e3o , the top tier of the Brazilian football league system . Santos are one of the only four clubs to have never been relegated , along with S\u00e3o Paulo , Flamengo and Cruzeiro .   The club was founded in 1912 by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by Raimundo Marques , M\u00e1rio Ferraz de Campos , and Argemiro de Souza J\u00fanior as a response to the lack of representation the city had in football . Since then , Santos became one of Brazil 's most successful clubs , becoming a symbol of Jogo Bonito -LRB- English : the Beautiful Game -RRB- in football culture , hence the motto `` T\u00e9cnica e Disciplina '' -LRB- Technique and discipline -RRB- . The most recognized Santista anthem is the `` Le\u00e3o do Mar '' written by Mangeri Neto . This was largely thanks to the Peixe 's golden generation of the 1960s which contained players such as Gilmar , Mauro Ramos , Meng\u00e1lvio , Coutinho , Pepe and Pel\u00e9 , named the `` Athlete of the Century '' by the International Olympic Committee , and widely regarded among football historians , former players and fans to be the best and most accomplished footballer in the game 's history . Os Sant\u00e1sticos , considered by some the best club team of all times , won a total of 24 titles during that decade including five consecutive Brasileir\u00f5es , a feat that remains unequaled until today . Os Sant\u00e1sticos also became the first squad in the world to win the Continental Treble , winning the Paulist\u00e3o , the Brasileir\u00e3o , and the Copa Libertadores in 1962 .   Santos is one of the most successful clubs in the Brasileir\u00e3o , becoming national champions on eight occasions . It has also won 21 Paulist\u00e3os , three Copa Libertadores , two European/South American Cups , one Supercopa de Campeones Intercontinentales , one Copa CONMEBOL -LRB- the precursor of current Copa Sudamericana -RRB- , one Copa do Brasil and one Recopa Sudamericana . In 1962 , Santos became the first club in the world to win four out of four competitions in a single year , thus completing the quadruple , comprising the aforementioned treble and the European/South American Cup . On January 20 , 1998 , Santos became the first team , in any category in the world , to reach the milestone of 10,000 goals in the entire history of football , scored by Jorginho .   The Peixe play their home games at the Vila Belmiro , which currently holds up to 20,120 spectators . Santos ' regular kit is white shirts , with white shorts , accompanied by white socks . Kappa are the kit manufacturers . Santos holds many long-standing rivalries , most notably against S\u00e3o Paulo , Palmeiras and Corinthians . It has contributed many key and famous players towards Brazil 's FIFA World Cup squads , including eleven world champions out of its 45 contributors and two FIFA World Cup winning captains . In 2013 , the club is the 2nd most valuable club in Brazil and Latin America , and 38th most valuable club in the world according to Brand Finance , worth over $ 65 million . In terms of revenue , Santos is Brazil 's 4th richest sports club and one of the biggest football clubs in the world , generating an annual turnover of over $ 114 million in 2012 . , The Brazil national football team -LRB- Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Futebol -RRB- represents Brazil in international men 's association football . Brazil is administered by the Brazilian Football Confederation -LRB- CBF -RRB- , the governing body for football in Brazil . They have been a member of the FIFA since 1923 and member of the CONMEBOL since 1916 . Brazil is the most successful national football team in international competition , winning FIFA World Cup with five championships : 1958 , 1962 , 1970 , 1994 and 2002 . Brazil also has the best overall performance in World Cup history in both proportional and absolute terms with a record of 70 victories in 104 matches played , 119 goal difference , 227 points and only 17 losses . Brazil is the only national team to have played in all World Cup editions without any absence nor need for playoffs . The sele\u00e7\u00e3o is also the most successful national team in the FIFA Confederations Cup with four titles : 1997 , 2005 , 2009 and 2013 , being the holder of the last title of the tournament .   The national football teams of Brazil , Argentina and France are the only national teams that have won the three most important men 's titles recognized by FIFA : the World Cup , the Confederations Cup , and the Olympic tournament . They have also won their respective continental championship -LRB- Copa Am\u00e9rica for Brazil and Argentina , and UEFA European Championship for France -RRB- .   Brazil has the all-time highest average Football Elo Rating with 2017.9 , and the third all time highest Football Elo Rating with 2160 in 1962 , only behind the Hungary Golden Team of 1954 and the German team of 2014 . Many distinguished commentators consider the Brazil team of 1970 to be the greatest association football team ever , although some argue the case for other teams , such as the Brazil team of 1958 or 1962 , with honorary mentions for the gifted 1982 side .   Brazil is the only national team to have won the World Cup on four different continents : once in Europe -LRB- 1958 Sweden -RRB- , once in South America -LRB- 1962 Chile -RRB- , twice in North America -LRB- 1970 Mexico and 1994 United States -RRB- and once in Asia -LRB- 2002 Korea/Japan -RRB- . They also share with Spain a record of 35 consecutive international matches undefeated .

He came third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 .   With 52 goals in 77 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18 , Neymar is the fourth-highest goalscorer for his national team . He was a key player in Brazil 's victories at the 2011 South American Youth Championship , which he finished as the leading goalscorer , and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup , where he won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament . His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica was cut short by injury and a suspension respectively , but the next year he captained Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men 's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics .   Known for his dribbling , finishing , and ability with both feet , Neymar has earned comparisons to former Brazil and Santos forward Pel\u00e9 . Off the pitch , he ranks among the world 's most prominent sportsmen ; SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013 , and ESPN cited him as the world 's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016 . , The 2011 Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica -LRB- officially the 2011 Copa Santander Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica for sponsorship reasons -RRB- was the 52nd edition of the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica , South America 's premier international club football tournament organized by CONMEBOL .

Every World Cup-winning team since the first edition in 1930 -- Argentina , Brazil , England , France , Germany , Italy , Spain and Uruguay -- qualified for this tournament . Spain , the title holders , were eliminated at the group stage , along with England and Italy . Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16 , and France exited in the quarter-finals . Host nation Brazil , who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup , lost to Germany 7 -- 1 in the semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place .

From 2001 to 2012 , the Copa do Brasil was played in the first half of the year and in those seasons , due to the busy schedule in the first half of the year in Brazil , teams playing in the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica were not allowed to participate in the Copa do Brasil in the same year .   Since 2013 , the tournament has run from March to November . Teams that contest the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica join the Copa do Brasil directly in Round of 16 . Also , the best 8 teams from the previous year 's Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A eliminated up to the third round qualify for Copa Sudamericana . , The 2011 South American Footballer of the Year , given to the best football player in South America by Uruguayan newspaper El Pa\u00eds through voting by journalists across the continent , was awarded to Neymar of Santos on December 31 , 2011 .

Originally , journalists could vote for South American players at any club around the world , but in 1986 , there was a change in rules to prohibit players not playing in South American leagues from winning the award . From 1998 , eligibility extended to South Americans playing in Mexico due to the participation of Mexican clubs in the Copa Libertadores .   The inaugural winner was Tost\u00e3o of Cruzeiro . Mario Kempes , who played for Spanish club Valencia , was the only player to win the award while playing in a non-South American league . Three players have won the award three times each : El\u00edas Figueroa of Internacional , Zico of Flamengo , and Carlos Tevez of Boca Juniors and Corinthians ; Figueroa and Tevez did so in consecutive years .

The films are currently in Phase Three , which began with the release of Captain America : Civil War -LRB- 2016 -RRB- .

It has inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes . The MCU has also been the focus of other media , outside of the shared universe , including attractions at the Disneyland Resort and Discovery Times Square , two television specials , guidebooks for each film , a Lego video game , and a commercial with Coca-Cola .

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "Military commanders of Indian and Chinese armies have been holding several rounds of talks to resolve the impasse at the four stand-off points in eastern Ladakh as the soldiers.  The meetings at Galwan region\u2019s Patrolling Point 14 - the site of a bloody clash on Monday evening that killed 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number from the Chinese side - have helped lower the tension at the border but from all available indicators, the two sides are far from a resolution.  Patrolling Point 14 is in control of the Indian army but the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers - which now claims Galwan valley as Chinese territory - are standing close by maintaining the face-off. India\u2019s border dispute with China that blew up this week takes the shine off the many agreements between the two sides not to let differences turn into disputes.  At Galwan, President Xi Jingping\u2019s PLA is trying to create a new one. Also Read: Ladakh isn\u2019t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialAnd it isn\u2019t only on its border with India that President Xi\u2019s China has manufactured a problem.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking during an online conference on democracy, attacked China for its \u201crogue\u201d attitude in its entire neighbourhood.  The US Navy has deployed its 300,000 tonne aircraft carriers to the Pacific Ocean on June 15.  This is the first biggest deployment of US super-carriers - USS Ronald Reagan, USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz - since 2017.  While the US has not attributed any security motives to the deployment, it is quite evident that the move is to counter Chinese aggressive posture over Taiwan. BhutanThe last stand-off between India and China was over Beijing\u2019s encroachment and construction activities at Doklam, at the India-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, that continued for 73 days.  China had backed out as part of the peace deal between India and China but according to multiple reports, was back at its game.  There have been similar such encroachments, construction activities and cases where Chinese patrols have intimidated Bhutanese graziers from accessing pasture lands within Bhutan territory in other sectors of Bhutan-China borders. South China SeaChina has been flexing its muscles for complete control over the resource-rich South China Sea.  China\u2019s claim to the waters based on \u201chistoric rights\u201d was turned down by a 2016 arbitration ruling but that hasn\u2019t stopped China from amping up efforts to militarise the zone. That South China sea is one of the world\u2019s busiest maritime trade routes that serves as a passage for annual trade worth $ 3. 5 trillion implies that this territorial claim impacts not just its smaller neighbours, but a larger number of countries. To be sure, China has island and maritime border disputes with Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea and its extension.  The disputes include islands, reefs, banks and other features in the South China Sea including Spratly Islands (with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan), Paracel Islands (Vietnam), Scarborough Shoal (Philippines), and Gulf of Tonkin (Vietnam). In addition, China claims the entire Taiwan and its controlled islands as its own. Eastern China SeaChina has Exclusive Economic Zone disputes with North Korea, South Korea and Japan in the Yellow Sea (North Koren/South Korea) and East China Sea (South Korea/Japan).  In addition, China claims Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands of Japan.  The area again sees a huge intra-region and global trade and Chinese claim would spill over the region and affect many more countries beyond the immediate region. NepalAround the same time that Kathmandu had objected to a fresh map issued by India last year, Nepal\u2019s Survey Department had accused China of having encroached Nepali land in northern districts of Humla, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankhuwasabha.  There were protests against China in Nepal after this survey report was leaked but Nepal\u2019s communist party didn\u2019t escalate the border dispute with China that has been pouring billions of rupees in investments into the country and kept the spotlight firmly on India\u2019s map instead.  China has also initiated an exercise to measure the height of Mount Everest and installed telecommunication equipment to provide 5G services on it.  In May, the state-run China Global Television Network claimed Mount Everest as part of China in a tweet but deleted the post after outrage. ",

    "evidence": "Farmers can sell their crops to pharma companies.  What?  Are you serious?  These are just the expressions that will pop into your head.  Many on social media are in fact mocking Congress president Rahul Gandhi for making this claim at a rally. A Facebook user called 'Kisan Neta-Raja Hayer' posted a video of the rally, claiming that the Congress chief said farm produce can be sold to pharmaceutical companies. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The claim attached with the video says, \"Durbhagyapurna ye bhai sahib hamare desh ke PM ke davedar hain.  Dawai bananewali factory main fasal bikwa denge bol raha hai hadd ho gai (Unfortunate, this man is a PM contender of this country.  He is saying he will help sell farm produce to pharma companies.  This is too much. )\"In the viral video, Rahul can be heard saying, \"We will make all efforts to solve the problems of local farmers and establish factories that make medicines around here so that goods can easily be sold to these pharma factories. \"The post has been viewed by 1,700 users at the time of filing this story. A Twitter user commented, \"Setting up pharma factories so that farmers can sell vegetables there. .  will this be considered fake news @GargiRawat @Nidhi? \"Setting up pharma factories so that farmers can sell vegetables there. .  will this be considered fake news @GargiRawat @Nidhi ?  https://t. co/BBnBsC4xmvWhen we looked for the video on the Internet, we found Rahul's original speech.  Rahul had addressed a rally in Chittorgarh on December 1 last year during the Rajasthan Assembly election.  It is mentioned rightly in the viral video too. In the original speech, Rahul starts with talking about local farm issues and elucidates on establishing a network of food processing units.  He then goes on to speak about setting up of pharmaceutical companies.  However, he never speaks about selling farm produce to pharma companies. In fact, Rahul's speech was much praised by the crowd present in the rally.  The reason being Chittorgarh is famous for growing opium, celery, isabgol and many such products which are used for making medicines.  Dainik Bhaskar had reported about this on December 25, 2018The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie. ",

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest , home to diverse wildlife , a variety of ecological systems , and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats . This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries , and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection .   Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral , who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire . Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 , when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro . In 1815 , the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves . Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil , a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system . The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature , now called the National Congress . The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'\u00e9tat . An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985 , after which civilian governance resumed .

The next day, an online advertisement teased news that purported that the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers received his private jet as a gift.  It read: \u201c[Photos] Tom Brady\u2019s Private Jet Was a Gift from Whom? \u201d The ad about Brady was surrounded by other misleading and strange advertisements.  One was about Monica Lewinsky\u2019s net worth.  Another ad about actor Jack Nicholson\u2019s house contained broken English.  It read: \u201c[Photos] Jack Nicholson is Old Now and Lives in Such House. \u201d Readers who clicked the ad about Brady purportedly owning a gifted private jet were led to a 119-page slideshow article.  They had to click \u201cnext page\u201d more than 100 times to reach the page about him.  He appeared near the end of the story.  It\u2019s true that Brady traveled on private jets in the past.  However, the story said nothing of his receiving one as a gift: Gisele Bundchen & Tom Brady \u2013 Gulfstream G550, Estimated $50 Million Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen had found a rather great solution for herself and her family since they are always on the go.  Her husband and she own a private jet in order to fly back and forth from their LA home to Brady\u2019s work in Boston as well as Gisele\u2019s work in Paris to San Paulo where her family resides permanently.  Brady doesn\u2019t commute with the rest of his team members when they head off to their games, instead, he travels with his wife and children in their sleek black Gulfstream jet.  Well, it might not be as fun but at least he gets more time with his family while traveling for work.  The ad appeared to be nothing more than clickbait and \u201carbitrage. \u201d In June 2008, The Boston Globe reported\u00a0Tom Brady\u2019s then-girlfriend Gisele B\u00fcndchen bought a Gulfstream G550 private jet.  However, on Jan.  24, 2021, Business Insider also reported that the couple \u201cdoesn\u2019t own a private jet. \u201d They married on Feb.  26, 2009.  Either way, there was no indication that Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen received a private jet as a gift.  Other celebrities mentioned in the lengthy article about private jets included Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mark Zuckerberg, and Mark Cuban. ",

It is bordered by Italy to the west , Austria to the north , Hungary to the northeast , Croatia to the south and southeast , and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest . It covers 20,273 km2 and has a population of 2.06 million . It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations , European Union , and NATO . The capital and largest city is Ljubljana .   The territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate , with the exception of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has an Alpine climate . Additionally , the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia . The country , marked by a significant biological diversity , is one of the most water-rich in Europe , with a dense river network , a rich aquifer system , and significant karst underground watercourses . Over half of the territory is covered by forest . The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven .   Slovenia has historically been the crossroads of South Slavic , Germanic , Romance , and Hungarian languages and culture . Although the population is not homogeneous , the majority is Slovene . South Slavic language Slovene is the official language throughout the country . Slovenia is a largely secularized country , but its culture and identity have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as Lutheranism . The economy of Slovenia is small , open , and export-oriented and has been strongly influenced by international conditions . It has been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis , started in the late 2000s . The main economic field is services , followed by industry and construction .   Historically , the current territory of Slovenia was part of many different state formations , including the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire , followed by the Habsburg Monarchy . In October 1918 , the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by co-founding the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs . In December 1918 , they merged with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes -LRB- renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 -RRB- . During World War II , Slovenia was occupied and annexed by Germany , Italy , and Hungary , with a tiny area transferred to the Independent State of Croatia , a Nazi puppet state . Afterward , it was a founding member of the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia , later renamed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , a communist state which was the only country in the Eastern Bloc which was never part of the Warsaw Pact . In June 1991 , after the introduction of multi-party representative democracy , Slovenia split from Yugoslavia and became an independent country . In 2004 , it entered NATO and the European Union ; in 2007 became the first formerly communist country to join the Eurozone ; and in 2010 joined the OECD , a global association of high-income developed countries .

Adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name by David Mitchell , the film has multiple plots set across six different eras , which Mitchell described as `` a sort of pointillist mosaic . '' The official synopsis describes it as `` an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past , present and future , as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero , and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution . '' Tom Hanks , Halle Berry , and Jim Broadbent lead an ensemble cast .   The film was produced by Grant Hill , Stefan Arndt , the Wachowskis , and Tykwer . During four years of development , the project met difficulties securing financial support ; it was eventually produced with a $ 102 million budget provided by independent sources , making it one of the most expensive independent films of all time . Production began in September 2011 at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam-Babelsberg , Germany .   It premiered on 8 September 2012 at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival and was released on 26 October 2012 in conventional and IMAX cinemas .

Governments are formed and run with a majority.  BJP\u2019s conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is very clear.  This is an insult to eight crore people of the state.  The governor should call for a session of the state\u2019s assembly so that the nation gets to know the truth,\u201d Rahul tweeted. Earlier, Ashok Gehlot led a large contingent of MLAs supporting him in buses to the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, where they laid siege on the lawns and shouted slogans demanding that Kalraj Mishra calls a session of the Rajasthan assembly. Gehlot, too, met the governor during the day seeking assurance that he will not succumb to \u201cpressure\u201d from above and take a decision on the matter in line with the constitution.  Before the Congress MLAs gathered for a show of strength at the Raj Bhawan, Gehlot had issued a warning, saying his government will not be responsible if people of the state surrounded the governor\u2019s house to protest against the delay in calling the session. Also Read: Rajasthan Guv writes to CM Gehlot, asks who is responsible for his security after MLAs\u2019 protestGehlot has said that he will prove his government\u2019s majority in the house ending speculations that it may not have the numbers after the rebellion by his former deputy and state congress chief Sachin Pilot and his 18 followers, also MLAs of the Congress party. The Congress MLAs left the governor house premises around 9 pm followed by a cabinet meeting called by Gehlot to discuss the current situation. Watch: Rajasthan Crisis | Mukul Rohatgi on high court\u2019s order on disqualification rowCongress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that governor Kalraj Mishra had given a note to Gehlot, which would be responded to immediately. \u201cCM wants to prove majority, call the assembly session on Covid crisis and wants to silence those who say Congress doesn\u2019t have a majority.  Governor told us he will abide by the Constitution.  He gave the CM a note that is to be looked into, then the governor will have to follow Article 174 of the Constitution,\u201d he said. ",

Martin began his career at age twelve with the all-boy pop group Menudo . After five years with the group , he released several Spanish-language solo albums throughout the 1990s . He also acted on stage and on TV in Mexico , becoming a modest star in the country . In 1994 he starred on the US TV soap opera General Hospital , playing a Puerto Rican singer .   In early 1999 , after releasing several albums in Spanish , Martin performed `` The Cup of Life '' at the 41st Grammy Awards show , which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene . Following its success , Martin released `` Livin ' la Vida Loca '' which helped him obtain enormous success worldwide and is generally seen as the song that began the Latin pop explosion of 1999 and made the transition easier for other Spanish-speaking artists to move into the English-speaking market . Since its release , the song has sold over 8 million copies , making it one of the best selling singles of all time . His first English-language album -LRB- also titled Ricky Martin -RRB- , has sold 22 million copies and is one of the best selling albums of all time . His other studio albums include : Me Amar\u00e1s -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , A Medio Vivir -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , Vuelve -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , Sound Loaded -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , Almas del Silencio -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , Life -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , M\u00fasica + Alma + Sexo -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , and A Quien Quiera Escuchar -LRB- 2015 -RRB- .

    "evidence": "At 345\u00a0feet (105\u00a0m) above mean sea level, Britton Hill in northern Walton County is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any U.S. state. Much of the state south of Orlando is low-lying and fairly level; however, some places, such as Clearwater, feature vistas that rise above the water. Much of Central and North Florida, typically or more away from the coastline, features rolling hills with elevations ranging from . The highest point in peninsular Florida, Sugarloaf Mountain, is a peak in Lake County. Much of Florida has an elevation of less than , including many populated areas such as Miami which are located on the coast. Miami and other parts of south Florida are the most vulnerable regions in the world to rising sea levels associated with climate change. Due to the vast amounts of limestone bedrock that Florida sits above, water is allowed to move relatively freely beneath dry land and to rise up to the surface. Water will also likely encroach from the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast, and up through the Everglades, endangering the plant biomass within its marsh communities .The elongated and sprawled layout of the South Florida metropolitan area complicates the process of designing practical mass transit systems that serve the entire region, in contrast to more circular shaped metro areas where a hub-and-spoke system can efficiently route passengers or automobiles to their destination. Miami's existing Green Line and proposed Orange Line would only form the spokes, which could only emanate towards the west due to Miami's coastal location. A line towards the coast to the east, known as Baylink, has been long proposed but at high cost and being met with opposition. The entire urbanized South Florida metropolitan area, being about long but no more than wide in any part, as well as covering three counties, complicates the creation of a unified transit system. Additionally, Miami is a relatively young city that saw much of its growth during the automobile age, and continues to be very car oriented. South Florida ranked fourth in the nation in a 2000 study of metro areas for percentage of household income spent on transportation, with an average of 19%. Many of the downtown high rises have their own very large, above ground parking garages, which form the base of the towers. As of the 2000 census, it was the eighth most densely populated metropolitan area in the United States, with the city of Miami growing at about a 10% growth rate. Of large municipalities in the region, the city of Miami has the highest percentage of residents using public transportation regularly, at about 17%. Though the general trend for public transit in South Florida is for gradual growth in ridership numbers, percentages are offset as the majority of the region has seen steady increases in population over time. At a 4% commuter share, South Florida ties the Gainesville, Florida metropolitan area for the highest ratio of public transport usage in Florida.",

The recommendation to cancel exams was prompted by an unprecedented health emergency, not by doubts about the value of examinations,\u201d it said.

Second, it protects the integrity of the examination by refusing to abandon its two most basic features \u2013 impartiality, or equal treatment of all examinees; and close supervision to prevent cheating, it said.

    "evidence": "Alter Bridge is an American rock band from Orlando , Florida , formed in 2004 . Since its formation , the band has consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Myles Kennedy , lead guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Tremonti , bassist Brian Marshall , and drummer Scott Phillips . The band is known for its acclaimed live shows and extensive touring .   Following Creed 's disbandment in 2004 , former members Tremonti , Marshall , and Phillips began working with Kennedy , formerly of The Mayfield Four . Named after a bridge that once existed on Alter Road near Tremonti 's former home in Detroit , Michigan , Alter Bridge released its debut album , One Day Remains , the same year . Despite mixed reviews , One Day Remains went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA . Driven by the release of the single `` Rise Today '' , the band released its second album , Blackbird , to more positive reviews in 2007 , embarking on a successful world tour in support . The album marked the beginning of a longtime collaboration with producer Michael Baskette , who has produced every Alter Bridge album since .   Tremonti , Marshall , and Phillips reunited with Creed for a tour and album in 2009 , while Kennedy began collaborating with Slash in 2010 , later fronting the guitarist 's band for a supporting tour . During this time , Alter Bridge continued to write material , and released its third album , AB III , in 2010 to critical acclaim , while the single `` Isolation '' became the band 's most successful single to date . The band embarked on a world tour in support of AB III from 2010 to 2012 .   Following the conclusion of the AB III tour , the members of Alter Bridge focused on other musical endeavors throughout 2012 , including solo and session work , another Creed tour , and Kennedy 's continued collaborations with Slash . Alter Bridge reconvened in early 2013 and released its fourth album , Fortress , to further acclaim later that year , also embarking on a world tour , lasting until late 2014 . In 2016 , following a U.S. tour with Disturbed and Breaking Benjamin , the band released its fifth album , The Last Hero , to positive reviews , followed by a European tour , Myles Richard Kennedy -LRB- born Myles Richard Bass ; November 27 , 1969 -RRB- is an American musician , singer , and songwriter , best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the rock band Alter Bridge , and as the lead vocalist in guitarist Slash 's backing band , known as Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators . A former guitar instructor from Spokane , Washington , he has worked as a session musician and songwriter , making both studio and live appearances with several artists , and has been involved with several projects throughout his career .   Born in Boston , Massachusetts , and raised in Northern Idaho and Spokane , Kennedy attended Spokane Falls Community College to study music theory . He began his music career in 1990 as the lead guitarist of the instrumental jazz ensemble Cosmic Dust , with which he released one studio album . His second band , Citizen Swing , released two studio albums before disbanding in 1996 . With fellow Citizen Swing member Craig Johnson , Kennedy founded the rock band The Mayfield Four , for which he provided lead vocals and guitar . The band released two studio albums and broke up in 2002 . After declining an offer to audition as the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver , he was asked to join Alter Bridge by Mark Tremonti in late 2003 , formally joining in 2004 , and he has been with the band ever since . He has released five studio albums with Alter Bridge .   While Alter Bridge was on tour in 2008 , Kennedy collaborated with former members of Led Zeppelin on an undisclosed project , though the band never fully materialized and the songs he wrote with Jimmy Page , John Paul Jones , and Jason Bonham remain unreleased . He then started working with Slash , featuring on the guitarist 's 2010 eponymous solo album on two tracks and later serving as Slash 's vocalist on tour . With Slash , Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators have recorded two studio albums . He has also been at work on a solo project of his own off and on since 2009 . ",

One author describes the dress as \"adding to the marital fervor and elevating matrimonial fashion\" and a major influence on women who strove to \"emulate Kelly\\'s peau de soie and lace masterpiece\". It was designed by Helen Rose of MGM. The dress consisted of a bodice with an attached under-bodice and skirt support. There were two petticoats, one being an attached foundation. The wedding attire included a headdress, veil, shoes and the lace- and pearl-encrusted prayer book which she carried down the aisle.

    "evidence": "Richard Burbage -LRB- 6 January 1567 -- 12 March 1619 -RRB- is considered the first great actor of English theatre . He is one of the most famous actors of the Globe Theatre of his time . In addition to being a stage actor he was also a theatre owner , entrepreneur and painter . He was the younger brother of Cuthbert Burbage . They were both actors in drama . Burbage was a business associate and friend to William Shakespeare .   The son of James Burbage , a joiner who became a theatrical impresario , and also founded the first theatre and was a famous theatrical entrepreneur . Burbage was a popular actor by his early 20s . He excelled in plays with the theme of tragedies . His early acting career is poorly documented . As many young actors of his time , he may have played the part of women in productions before taking any of the roles he is known for . It has been suggested that he spent time working with the Earl of Leicester 's company , but there is no good evidence for this . He was probably acting with the Admiral 's Men in 1590 , with Lord Strange 's Men in 1592 , and with the Earl of Pembroke 's Men in 1593 ; but most famously he was the star of William Shakespeare 's theatre company , the Lord Chamberlain 's Men which became the King 's Men on the ascension of James I in 1603 . He played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare 's plays , including Hamlet , Othello , Richard III , and King Lear . But he was in great demand and also appeared in the plays of many of the great contemporary writers , such as Ben Jonson -LRB- the title role in Volpone , and Subtle in The Alchemist -RRB- , John Marston -LRB- The Malcontent -RRB- , John Webster -LRB- The Duchess of Malfi -RRB- and Beaumont and Fletcher -LRB- The Maid 's Tragedy -RRB- .   Burbage 's power and scope as an actor is revealed in the sheer size of the roles he played . He was a great box office draw . Of the hundreds of plays and thousands of roles for actors that date from the 1580 -- 1610 era , there are only twenty or so roles that are longer than 800 lines . Edward Alleyn was the first English actor to manage such roles , in Marlowe 's Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta ; but the majority of these star roles , thirteen of the twenty , were acted by Burbage.He was said to be quite rich because he was earning income from being the primary housekeeping of two playhouses , a sharer in the King 's Men , a lead actor and a painter .   His acting style is closely compared with the method that actors use today called method acting ; it would be another four centuries before this came into popularity . He was described as being short and stout , but said to be an impressive figure , with numerous praises written of him in contemporary accounts . ",

The outbreak, gripping the length of the country, has been detected in 13 states - Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh.  While the flu in poultry birds has been reported from nine states - Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, 12 states have reported the outbreak in crow, migratory birds and wild birds.  These states include - Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. \"Till 22nd January, 2021 outbreaks of Avian Influenza (Bird flu) have been confirmed in 9 States (Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab) for poultry birds and in 12 States (Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab) for Crow/Migratory/ Wild birds,\" a statement by ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying on Friday read. The flu has been confirmed in poultry samples from Uttarakhand's Almora and Gujarat's Somnath, the ministry said. In crows, the flu has been confirmed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama) and Uttarkhand's Kaliji Pheasantbird in Tehri range, the ministry said. Avian Influenza has been confirmed in crows in the States of UT of Jammu and Kashmir(Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama); in Kaliji Pheasantbird inTehri range of Uttarakhand. Soon after the outbreak killed more than 25,000 birds earlier this month, the government had rushed to control the outbreak and prevent further spread by asking states to strengthen the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfect the affected areas, and properly dispose of dead birds and carcasses. The animal husbandry ministry had also asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan. To prevent the disease transmission from affected birds to poultry and humans, the ministry has asked states to follow the general prevention guidelines. \u201cCoordination with the forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States.  The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds.  It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say.  There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say.  According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans.  Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus. The Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has previously pointed to migratory birds as a cause for the spread of flu which has triggered an alarm in north, central and southern India.  \u201cIn India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i. e.  from September-October to February-March.  The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,\u201d the ministry had said. ",

    "evidence": "Heroin , also known as diamorphine among other names , is an opiate most commonly used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects . Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and in opioid replacement therapy . Heroin is typically injected , usually into a vein ; however , it can also be smoked , snorted or inhaled . Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours .   Common side effects include respiratory depression -LRB- decreased breathing -RRB- and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent . Other side effects can include abscesses , infected heart valves , blood borne infections , constipation , and pneumonia . After a history of long-term use , withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use . When given by injection into a vein , heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine . It typically comes as a white or brown powder .   Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications . Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone . A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone . An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin , which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths . The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable . In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time . When people die from overdosing on a drug , the drug is usually an opioid .   Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine , a natural product of the opium poppy . Internationally , heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs . It is generally illegal to make , possess , or sell heroin without a license . In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66 % of the world 's opium . Often heroin , which is illegally sold , is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine . ",

    "evidence": "In March 2020, actor Tom Hanks was in Queensland, Australia, for the filming of a biopic about singer Elvis Presley, when he and his wife Rita Wilson went to a hospital \u201cafter feeling run down\u201d and tested positive for COVID-19. Subsequently, a conspiracy meme shared on social media asserted that the actor had not been affected by COVID-19 at all, and claimed that report was a cover-up for Hanks\u2019 having been taken into custody for \u201cpedophilia,\u201d and fitted with an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts:  Obviously, if a person as globally prominent as Hanks had been arrested \u2014 especially on such a shocking charge \u2014 that fact would have been international news, so the total lack of any news reporting about it demonstrates it to be nothing more than a spurious and cruel rumor. Unfortunately, Hanks has been one of multiple celebrities \u2014 along with others such as Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres \u2014 who have become the target of bizarre conspiracy theories about their alleged involvement in \u201celite pedophile sex trafficking rings.\u201d The top two photographs in the meme, showing Hanks wearing a green T-shirt and green bandana, were taken in Los Angeles in May 2020. Obviously, Hanks couldn\u2019t have been in custody in Australia at that time. The bottom two photographs appear to show nothing more than the hem or cuff from his pant leg. Other photographs from the same time and place don\u2019t provide any convincing evidence of Hanks\u2019 having an ankle bracelet on one of his legs, either. It also makes no sense that Australian authorities have would arrested Hanks on a serious charge, placed him in custody, and deemed him a \u201cflight risk,\u201d then turned him loose to return to the U.S. a few weeks later with no precaution other than a monitoring bracelet. Photographs of Hanks taken more recently, in June and July 2020, captured the actor wearing shorts and sandals, and clearly showed he was not sporting an ankle bracelet.

    "evidence": "His announcement is a major boost to Mitch McConnell's effort to secure support.How does the Supreme Court justice nomination process work?Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, announced Tuesday that he will support a vote on his Supreme Court nominee this year -- which could happen before the Nov. 3 presidential election.\u201cThe Constitution gives the President the power to nominate and the Senate the authority to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court nominees. Accordingly, I intend to follow the Constitution and precedent in considering the President\u2019s nominee. If the nominee reaches the Senate floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cMy decision regarding a Supreme Court nomination is not the result of a subjective test of \u2018fairness\u2019 which, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. It is based on the immutable fairness of following the law, which in this case is the Constitution and precedent. The historical precedent of election year nominations is that the Senate generally does not confirm an opposing party\u2019s nominee but does confirm a nominee of its own,\" he said.Romney's announcement is a major boost to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's effort to lock down GOP support for a nomination vote over angry Democratic objections.McConnell can afford to lose three of the 53 Republican senators and still get a nominee confirmed because Vice President Mike Pence would break any tie.Romney was seen as a possible vulnerability for Republicans being the only GOP senator to vote to convict Trump during his impeachment trial.But he dashed Democratic hopes he would join GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who have stated they oppose moving forward before the election. They've cited the Republican move in 2016 to block Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy nearly nine months before Election Day, when Republicans then argued it was too close to the election.Romney said Tuesday that he does not believe moving forward with a nomination now -- with the election just six weeks away -- is inconsistent with the GOP position on the Garland nomination.When Garland was nominated, Republicans controlled the Senate. Romney, echoing the argument many Republicans have made in recent days, said he believes the circumstances are different now because Republicans have control of both the White House and the Senate.\"I think there's some perception on the part of some writers and others that, 'Gee, what happened with Merrick Garland and some others was unfair.' I don't agree with that,\" Romney said. \"It wasn't unfair because it was consistent with history.\"Romney's announcement keeps him in lockstep with McConnell who on Tuesday said \"history and precedent were on this Senate majority side in 2016 and they are overwhelmingly on our side now.\"Other Republicans are also lining up behind McConnell.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia also announced Tuesday that she believes President Trump should be allowed to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Without at least four Republicans joining their efforts to block the nomination, Democrats have few means to stop McConnell from moving forward.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans Tuesday of using \"brute political force\" to push for a quick vote despite laying out a different set of rules in 2016.\"Leader McConnell has defiled the Senate like no one in this generation and Leader McConnell may very well destroy it,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"If leader McConnell presses forward the Republican majority would have stolen two Supreme Court seats four years apart using completely contradictory rationales.\"On \"This Week\" on Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday suggested to ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that Democrats were considering all procedural options at their disposal to delay a nominee, not ruling out a new impeachment effort.\"We have our options,\" Pelosi said.  \"We have arrows in our quiver that I'm not about to discuss right now but the fact is we have a big challenge in our country.\"In days since, some Democrats have signaled they could be open to adding additional justices to the Supreme Court bench if Democrats were to take the Senate majority in November.McConnell, also on the Senate floor Tuesday, said Democrats are stoking \"outrage and hysteria.\"\"Giving in to political blackmail would not do a thing to secure our institutions,\" McConnell said. \"You do not put a stop to irresponsible hostage taking by making hostage-taking a winning strategy.\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

It is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera . It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands , with an area of approximately 73 km2 and a 2011 census population of 15,550 . The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni , Palaia Kameni , Aspronisi , and Christiana . The total land area is 90.623 km2 . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit .   Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements on a formerly single island , and created the current geological caldera . A giant central , rectangular lagoon , which measures about 12 by , is surrounded by 300 m high , steep cliffs on three sides . The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea . On the fourth side , the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia ; the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places , in the northwest and southwest . The depth of the caldera , at 400m , makes it impossible for any but the largest ships to anchor anywhere in the protected bay ; there is also a fisherman 's harbour at Vlychada , on the southwestern coast . The island 's principal port is Athinios . The capital , Fira , clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon . The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine , and have a small presence of hornblende .   It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc , though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera . The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km long and 20 to wide . The region first became volcanically active around 3 -- 4 million years ago , though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri .   The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history : the Minoan eruption -LRB- sometimes called the Thera eruption -RRB- , which occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization . The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , 110 km to the south , through a gigantic tsunami . Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis . ",

    "evidence": "A post with an old black & white video of a man practising Yoga is being widely shared across social media platforms with the claim that the video shows young Narendra Modi practising Yoga. Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The video actually shows B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of the style of Yoga called \u2018Iyengar Yoga\u2019 practising Yoga in his young age. A documentary about Iyengar by a Telugu devotional channel featured similar visuals. Many videos of Iyengar practising Yoga at this age are available on the internet. This video has nothing to do with Modi. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. Reverse image search of the video led us to a documentary about famous Yoga teacher B. K. S. Iyengar, founder of the style of Yoga called \u2018Iyengar Yoga\u2019 by a Telugu devotional channel which carried visuals similar to the one in the post. In this documentary, these visuals are displayed at the timestamp 2:09 and the voice-over introducing Iyengar, which implies these visuals are of Iyengar practising Yoga. Taking a cue from the video, further YouTube search with relevant keywords led us to a lengthier version of the video in the post. The description of the video reads \u2018Krishnamacharya & B. K. S. Iyengar in 1938 with Yoga Sutras, Part 1of 6\u2019. Further search led us to a news article which stated that a 1938 film featuring T Krishnamacharya and BKS Iyengar was part of an exhibition on yogic art titled \u201cYoga: The Art of Transformation\u201d held at Washington DC in 2013. Taking a cue from the article, YouTube search with relevant keywords led us to the video related to the exhibition, at a timestamp of 0:48 we can see visuals similar to one in the post. Also, there are many videos and images on internet similar to the visuals of the video in the post attributing them to BKS Iyengar. With all these, we can conclude that the video in the post does not show Modi practising Yoga. To sum it up, the video shows famous Yoga teacher BKS Iyengar practising Yoga, not Narendra Modi. ",

Time Magazine named Devdas as the best movie of 2002 among all the movies released around the world that year . The film was recently included in Time Magazine 's top 10 movies of the millennium worldwide .   The acting was seen by many as the primary factor for the film 's success , with Shah Rukh Khan , Madhuri Dixit , and Aishwarya Rai all winning Filmfare Awards for their performances . The film 's success was also attributed to the dance performances , with Dixit 's `` Maar Daala '' considered one of the most iconic of her career and the song `` Dola Re Dola '' becoming a hit due to the unique dance duet between Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit , two of the leading actresses of the epoch . At the time of its release , Devdas was the most expensive Bollywood film ever produced , with a reported budget of . The film was a commercial success in India and abroad , becoming the highest grossing Indian film of the year . Shah Rukh Khan has bought the rights to this film under his banner , Red Chillies Entertainment . , World War II -LRB- often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 -RRB- , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 , although related conflicts began earlier . It involved the vast majority of the world 's countries -- including all of the great powers -- eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . It was the most widespread war in history , and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries . In a state of `` total war '' , the major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . Marked by mass deaths of civilians , including the Holocaust -LRB- in which approximately 11 million people were killed -RRB- and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres -LRB- in which approximately one million were killed , and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -RRB- , it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities . These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history .   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937 , but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . Supplied by the Soviet Union , from late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , the Balkan Campaign as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic . On 22 June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis ' military forces into a war of attrition . In December 1941 , Japan attacked the United States and European colonies in the Pacific Ocean , and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific .   The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway , near Hawaii , and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then , decisively , at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union . In 1943 , with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front , the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender , and Allied victories in the Pacific , the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts . In 1944 , the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France , while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies . During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma , while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands .   The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union , culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 . Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms , the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively . With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent , the possibility of additional atomic bombings , and the Soviet Union 's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria , Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 . Thus ended the war in Asia , cementing the total victory of the Allies .   World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world . The United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts . The victorious great powers -- the United States , the Soviet Union , China , the United Kingdom , and France -- became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers , setting the stage for the Cold War , which lasted for the next 46 years . Meanwhile , the influence of European great powers waned , while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began . Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery . Political integration , especially in Europe , emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity . ",

    "evidence": "India\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic rose to 1007 on Wednesday after 73 fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours as the country stepped up to ease the restrictions under the lockdown that have already lasted more than a month. The number of infected people jumped to 31,332, the Union health ministry data showed at 8am, with 1897 new cases of Covid-19.  The rate of recovery rose to 24. 55% after 827 people were sent home after being cured, the health ministry\u2019s dashboard showed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has indicated that the lockdown could continue beyond May 3 in parts of the country worst affected by the pandemic identified as hotspots. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDespite the national lockdown that has kept people mostly indoors amid strict restrictions, Maharashtra and Gujarat continued to report some of the biggest spikes in the country. There were 11,196 cases of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, including 400 deaths and 1388 people who have been sent home from hospitals.  In Gujarat, 4359 people have been infected by Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, out of which 181 have died. The two states have a doubling rate for infections at 8. 3 days and 8. 8 days respectively.  The overall doubling rate for the country is 10. 8 days, down from 4 days at the beginning of the month. Delhi has 87 more patients of Covid-19 at 4446 but the number of fatalities in the national capital is less than the western state at 54.  Click here for Covid-19 live updatesDelhi and 14 districts across the country account for more than 60% of all Covid-19 cases reported in India, according to data from the federal think tank NITI Aayog. Delhi, which has 11 districts, accounts for 12. 62% of all cases in the country as of Monday.  Mumbai and Indore feature among the list of the 14 other districts. As the number of cases jumped, the health ministry has cautioned against the usage of plasma therapy, increasingly being seen as a magic bullet to cure critically ill Covid-19 patients, as a regular line of treatment. It said the therapy of transfusion of antibody-rich plasma, a component of blood, from recovered patients of Covid-19 into those who are critically ill with the disease, should only be done as a trial and with all requisite approvals. Some of the recovered patients in India have already donated plasma.  \u201cICMR is doing a pan-India study to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent therapy in critically ill Covid-19 patients, and until they come out with specific guidelines on it, no one should use it as a treatment modality for Covid-19 patients as it could not only be harmful but is also illegal,\u201d said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), earlier this month, had issued a detailed document on the study model using plasma therapy, which has shown promise in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Globally, there are 3,114,659 people who have been infected and 217,153 of them have died due to the respiratory illness.  The United States recorded its one-millionth case of new coronavirus, about one-third of the entire world\u2019s caseload, and 58,351 deaths on Tuesday. ",

Located in the City of Westminster , the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality . It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning .   Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen 's House . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 .   The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , including the East front , which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds . The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II ; the Queen 's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection .   The original early 19th-century interior designs , many of which survive , include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis , on the advice of Sir Charles Long . King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle \u00c9poque cream and gold colour scheme . Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House .

Upon creation , Westminster was awarded city status , which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster .   Aside from a number of large parks and open spaces , the population density of the district is high . Many sites commonly associated with London are in the borough , including St. James 's Palace , Buckingham Palace , the Houses of Parliament , and 10 Downing Street . The borough is divided into a number of localities including the ancient political district of Westminster around the Palace of Westminster ; the shopping areas around Oxford Street , Regent Street , Piccadilly and Bond Street ; and the night time entertainment district of Soho . Much of the borough is residential , and in 2008 it was estimated to have a population of 236,000 . The local authority is Westminster City Council . ",

The men seen with PM in this picture are not persecuted Hindus from Pakistan.  VERIFICATIONUsing reverse-image search, we found the same image posted in PM Modi's official website.  The photo features in a post titled 'Beyond the Emergency' and is captioned as 'Narendra Modi in a village of Gujarat'.  As per the post this image was clicked in 1980s when Modi was made the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sambhaag Pracharak\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (equivalent of a regional organiser) as an appreciation of his activism and organisational work during the preceding years of Emergency.  He was given charge of South and Central Gujarat.  As a part of his role, Modi traveled increasingly across Gujarat in the early 1980s.  This gave him the opportunity to visit every Taluka and almost every village in the state.  It gave him a first hand view of the problems people face and increased his resolve to work harder to solve them.  When droughts, floods or riots struck he would lead the relief efforts too.  We also searched on Google with keywords 'Modi Barmer Hindus Pakistan' and found no photo of PM meeting with persecuted Hindus from Pakistan in Barmer.  However, we found a post from The Hindu dated April 12, 2014, where in his maiden mass-contact meeting in the Barmer constituency, the then BJP prime ministerial candidate promised that Pakistani Hindu refugees will be given equal rights and treated like other Indian citizens.

It is a major vacation spot that around two million people visit every year . It is the second largest man-made reservoir by maximum water capacity in the United States behind Lake Mead , storing 24,322,069 acre.ft of water when full . However , due to high water withdrawals for human and agricultural consumption , and because of subsequent droughts in the area , Lake Powell is currently larger than Lake Mead in terms of volume of water currently held , depth and surface area .   Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the Glen Canyon Dam , which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area , a popular summer destination . The reservoir is named for explorer John Wesley Powell , a one-armed American Civil War veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869 .   In 1972 , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established . It is public land managed by the National Park Service , and available to the public for recreational purposes . It lies in parts of Garfield , Kane , and San Juan counties in southern Utah , and Coconino County in northern Arizona . The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the Hite Crossing Bridge . A map centered at the confluence of the Escalante River with the Colorado River gives a good view of the extent of the lake .   Lake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the Colorado River Compact -LRB- Colorado , Utah , Wyoming , and New Mexico -RRB- .

It was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron 's surpassing of Babe Ruth 's career home run mark of 714 home runs . The award was the first major award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in 19 years .   For the 1999 season , a winner was selected using an objective points system . Hits , home runs , and runs batted in -LRB- RBI -RRB- were given certain point values and the winner was the player who had the highest tabulated points total .   In 2000 , the system was changed to a ballot in which each MLB team 's radio and television play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts voted for three players in each league . Their first place vote receives five points , the second place vote receives three points , and the third place vote receives one point . Beginning in 2003 , fans were given the opportunity to vote via MLB 's official website , MLB.com . Fans ' votes account for 30 % of the points , while broadcasters ' and analysts ' votes account for the other 70 % .   The 2004 -- 2006 Hank Aaron Award was decided in three separate phases . In August fans voted at each Club 's official Web site from among three players nominated by the respective Club . The leading vote getter from each Club became one of 30 finalists , from which a special Major League Baseball panel chose six finalists from each League . Online fan voting then determined the overall League winner .   In 2007 -- 2008 five finalists in each league were determined in fan balloting on MLB.com , from 30 club nominees selected by a special panel assembled by Major League Baseball and MLB.com . Online fan votes decided the overall League winner .   For the 2009 Award fans selected both the finalists and the ultimate winners of the award . In September fans voted for one finalist out of three nominees from each MLB Club . Once those 30 finalists were selected , fans voted for one American League and one National League winner , from September 16 -- 30 .   The award is handed out to the winners of both leagues before Game 4 of the World Series every year , with Aaron himself presenting the awards .   The first winners of the award were Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa in 1999 , while the most recent winners are David Ortiz and Kris Bryant . Alex Rodriguez has won the award four times , the most of any player . The winner with the most hits is Todd Helton , who won as a Colorado Rockies in 2000 . The winner with the most home runs is Barry Bonds from 2001 , and Manny Ram\u00edrez in 1999 has the most RBIs . , The 2007 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft was Major League Baseball 's annual amateur draft of high school and college baseball players , and was held on June 7 , 2007 , and June 8 , 2007 .

She was born an Archduchess of Austria , and was the fifteenth and second youngest child of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis I , Holy Roman Emperor .   In April 1770 , upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste , heir apparent to the French throne , she became Dauphine of France .

After eight years of marriage , Marie Antoinette gave birth to a daughter , Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charlotte , the first of her four children .

The Diamond Necklace affair damaged her reputation further . During the Revolution , she became known as Madame D\u00e9ficit because the country 's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of Turgot and Necker .   During the Revolution , after the government had placed the royal family under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace in October 1789 , several events linked to Marie Antoinette , in particular the June 1791 attempted flight to Varennes and her role in the War of the First Coalition , had disastrous effects on French popular opinion . On 10 August 1792 , the attack on the Tuileries forced the royal family to take refuge at the Assembly , and on 13 August the family was imprisoned in the Temple . On 21 September 1792 , the monarchy was abolished .

Since the band 's formation in 1989 , its line-up remained unchanged until the firing of Weiland in 2013 , who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington . In 2015 , Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park . On December 3 , 2015 , Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts . In 2016 , the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist .   After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young , the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots . The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album , Core -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s . The band released four more studio albums : Purple -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , Tiny Music ... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , No. 4 -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and Shangri-La Dee Da -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , before separating in 2002 , after which the band members partook in various projects -LRB- most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone -RRB- . The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour , released a new self-titled album in 2010 , and actively toured until Chester Bennington 's departure . The band 's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013 .   While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career , further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences , including psychedelic rock , bossa nova and classic rock . The band 's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows , brought about in part by Weiland 's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction . , Eric Kretz -LRB- born June 7 , 1966 -RRB- is an American musician and producer , best known as the drummer for the rock band Stone Temple Pilots . He is of German descent . He has also played for Talk Show and Spiralarms . Eric , who was born in San Jose , California , attended and graduated from Willow Glen High School in San Jose in 1984 . He currently owns and operates Bomb Shelter Studios in Los Angeles . While in STP , Kretz has kept somewhat of a low profile but still contributed to the band 's songwriting , most notably writing the music to the band 's 1996 hit `` Trippin ' on a Hole in a Paper Heart . '' Along with lead vocalist Scott Weiland , Kretz also wrote the lyrics to the Grammy Award-winning hit `` Plush '' off STP 's 1992 debut Core . Kretz has worked with several notable artists , particularly engineering and mixing the live recordings for The Henry Rollins Show of songs by artists such as Thom Yorke , Ben Harper , Damian Marley , Slayer , Jurassic 5 , Death Cab for Cutie , and more .

Geographically located in the South Central region of the country , Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east , Arkansas to the northeast , Oklahoma to the north , New Mexico to the west , and the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas to the southwest , while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast .   Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S. , while San Antonio is the second most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas -- Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country , respectively . Other major cities include Austin , the second most populous state capital in the U.S. , and El Paso . Texas is nicknamed `` The Lone Star State '' to signify its former status as an independent republic , and as a reminder of the state 's struggle for independence from Mexico . The `` Lone Star '' can be found on the Texan state flag and on the Texan state seal . The origin of Texas 's name is from the word `` Tejas , '' which means `` friends '' in the Caddo language .   Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions . Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts , less than 10 % of Texas ' land area is desert . Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west , one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills , and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend .   The term `` six flags over Texas `` For example , as used by the large Grand Prairie -- based national and international amusement park operator Six Flags refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory . Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas . France held a short-lived colony . Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence , becoming an independent Republic . In 1845 , Texas joined the union as the 28th state . The state 's annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican -- American War in 1846 . A slave state before the American Civil War , Texas declared its secession from the U.S. in early 1861 , and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March 2 of the same year . After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government , Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation .   One Texan industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle . Due to its long history as a center of the industry , Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy . The state 's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century , when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state . With strong investments in universities , Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century . As of 2015 , it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54 . With a growing base of industry , the state leads in many industries , including agriculture , petrochemicals , energy , computers and electronics , aerospace , and biomedical sciences . Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product . ",

Filming began in February 1989 after two years were spent building the sets and writing the scripts . Two actors from the first film , Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells , did not return for the final two . While Elisabeth Shue was recast in the role of Wells ' character , Jennifer , Glover 's character , George McFly , was not only minimized in the plot , but also was obscured and recreated with another actor . Glover successfully sued both Zemeckis and Gale , changing how producers can deal with the departure and replacement of actors in a role . Back to the Future Part II was also a ground-breaking project for effects studio Industrial Light & Magic -LRB- ILM -RRB- : In addition to digital compositing , ILM used the VistaGlide motion control camera system , which allowed an actor to portray multiple characters simultaneously on-screen without sacrificing camera movement .   Back to the Future Part II was released by Universal Pictures on November 22 , 1989 . The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $ 331 million worldwide , making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1989 . ",

    "evidence": "The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear a petition seeking removal of the farmers protesting against the Centre\u2019s farm laws from Delhi borders. The farmers have been protesting at Singhu and other border points of Delhi since November 26 seeking the repeal of the three laws passed in September. The petition has been filed by law student Rishabh Sharma and will be heard by a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde, justice A S Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian.  Sharma has said in his petition that commuters are facing hardships due to the road blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said on Tuesday that the farmers are being misled about the reforms introduced by his government in the agriculture sector.  He also lashed out at the opposition parties and farmer organisations. Modi expressed surprise at the protests triggered by the reforms his government introduced in September.  Some opposition parties and farmers\u2019 unions had all along demanded such measures, which couldn\u2019t be implemented in the past, he said at Dhordo in Kutch, Gujarat. \u201cThe farmers are being misled about the agricultural reforms.  They are being fooled into believing that others will occupy their lands,\u201d PM Modi said in Hindi.  \u201cThese reforms are exactly the same that farmers\u2019 organisations and even the opposition have been asking over the years,\u201d he said. The farmers are protesting against the recently enacted Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.  Meanwhile, farmer leaders on Tuesday asserted that they will \u201cmake\u201d the Centre repeal the three new agri laws in a hardening of their stand.  The union leaders again made it clear the government should first repeal all the three laws and only then there can be further talks.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The second phase of the Budget Session of Parliament opened to protests from the opposition parties on Monday with leaders demanding action in the riots in north-east Delhi, which has claimed more than 40 lives so far.  The House was adjourned several times and once after members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha.  Members of the Congress party, including its Leader of Opposition Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Gaurav Gogoi, Manickam Tagore and SU Thirunavukkarasar, pressed for adjournment motions, to discuss the Delhi riots which the party described as a \u201ccommunal conflagration\u201d.  In all, 23 notices of adjournment were filed by opposition members.  Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, then carried out a protest outside the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, demanding the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah.  Members of the Trinamool Congress also protested outside the statue of Mahatma Gandhi before the House convened, where MPs blindfolded their eyes with black cloth.  The Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s (AAP) members, too, filed adjournment motions.  Once the House convened, several Opposition MPs rose to protest against the Delhi riots, demanding a discussion.  However, Speaker Om Birla adjourned the House till 2pm after an obituary reference to JD(U) member from Bihar\u2019s Valmiki Nagar Baidyanath Prasad Mahto, who died on February 28. Later, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day after the protest in the House led to jostling between opposition MPs and treasury benches. But a revised notice said it was adjourned till 3pm. Congress MP Ramya Haridas alleged she was hit by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Jasleen Kaur and she went to complain to the Speaker with some of her women colleagues.  The House was adjourned till 4pm as a result. Govt agendaGovernment business in Lok Sabha includes the introduction of The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020.  The Union Cabinet on Wednesday (29 January) approved increasing the time limit for conducting a medical abortion from the current 20 weeks to 24 weeks and allowed the option for \u201cspecial categories of women\u201d that would include \u2018vulnerable women\u2019 such as rape survivors, victims of incest, differently-abled and minors. The Mineral Laws (Amendment) Bill will also be introduced. Later in the day, the government plans to pass The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Bill in the Lower House. In Rajya Sabha, the government wants to pass the Central Sanskrit Universities Bill that aims to establish and incorporate Universities for teaching and research in Sanskrit. Another important legislation, The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill will also be brought for passage.  The legislation aims a medical education system that improves access to quality and affordable medical education, ensures availability of adequate and high-quality professionals of Indian System of Medicine. The Centre may also bring The National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill to promote high-quality Homoeopathy medical professionals in the Upper House. Opposition plansBut this elaborate legislative agenda may hit a roadblock amid opposition plans to protest and bring adjournment motion on Delhi riots, demand Amit Shah\u2019s resignation. The Congress and other opposition parties also want to target the ruling dispensation over the economy and farmers\u2019 plight. The BJP has sounded ready to take on the Opposition.  Union minister Anurag Thakur on Sunday demanded strict action against those involved in the violence in north-east Delhi but claimed he was not involved in hate speech. \u201cFrom Monday, Parliament session will begin, questions are raised there also from economy to various other issues and on that platform, answers will be given on various matters,\u201d Thakur said in Chandigarh.  Congress\u2019 floor leader Adhir Chowdhury announced on Sunday that the party will \u201cstrongly raise\u201d the issue of communal riots in Delhi and demand Shah\u2019s resignation over alleged police lapses.  \u201cThe government has miserably failed to maintain law and order.  I think there must be some sort of a nexus between the rioters and a section of police officials which resulted in gruesome killings and arson that has tarnished our image across the globe.  This is a matter of serious concern for us,\u201d he said.  Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has already hit out at Congress president Sonia Gandhi for instigating violence and questioning the rival party\u2019s shifting policies. Party\u2019s senior leader in Rajya Sabha, Abhishek Singhvi, added that the \u201cwanton destruction of democratic values\u201d in this country with the \u201cactive approbation\u201d and, frequently, the selective \u201cNelsonian blind eye\u201d of the government will be taken up in the strongest possible terms. \u201cThe country is assured that we will discharge our responsibilities vigorously and without fear, despite extreme and illegal intrusion and harassment,\u201d Singhvi said. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has already set the tone by repeatedly demanding Shah\u2019s resignation - first in a rare press conference after a meeting of the party\u2019s working committee on Wednesday and then in her memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday. The second phase of the budget session is scheduled from March 2 to April 3. ",

In particular , `` curse '' may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power , such as a god or gods , a spirit , or a natural force , or else as a kind of spell by magic or witchcraft ; in the latter sense , a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx . In many belief systems , the curse itself -LRB- or accompanying ritual -RRB- is considered to have some causative force in the result . To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called `` removal '' or `` breaking '' , and is often believed to require elaborate rituals or prayers .   The study of the forms of curses comprise a significant proportion of the study of both folk religion and folklore . The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of magic . In Hindu culture the Sage or Rishi is believed to have the power to bless and curse . Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha and the one placed by Rishi Devala .  Special names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures :  African American hoodoo presents us with the jinx and crossed conditions , as well as a form of foot track magic which was used by Ramandeep , whereby cursed objects are laid in the paths of victims and activated when walked over .  Middle Eastern and Mediterranean culture is the source of the belief in the evil eye , which may be the result of envy but , more rarely , is said to be the result of a deliberate curse . In order to be protected from the evil eye , a protection item is made from dark blue circular glass , with a circle of white around the black dot in the middle , which is reminiscent of a human eye . The size of the protective eye item may vary .  German people , including the Pennsylvania Dutch speak in terms of hexing -LRB- from the German word for witchcraft -RRB- , and a common hex in days past was that laid by a stable-witch who caused milk cows to go dry and horses to go lame .

He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War , and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution . He is popularly considered the driving force behind the nation 's establishment and came to be known as the `` father of the country , '' both during his lifetime and to this day .   Washington was widely admired for his strong leadership qualities and was unanimously elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections . He oversaw the creation of a strong , well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars , suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion , and won acceptance among Americans of all types . Washington 's incumbency established many precedents still in use today , such as the cabinet system , the inaugural address , and the title Mr. President . His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term . The 22nd Amendment -LRB- 1951 -RRB- now limits the president to two elected terms .   He was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves , which he inherited . In his youth , he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War . In 1775 , the Second Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution . In that command , Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776 but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City .   After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter , he defeated the British in two battles -LRB- Trenton and Princeton -RRB- , retook New Jersey , and restored momentum to the Patriot cause . His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781 . Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals ; preservation and command of the army ; coordination with the Congress , state governors , and their militia ; and attention to supplies , logistics , and training . In battle , however , Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies .   After victory had been finalized in 1783 , Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power , proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism . Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787 , which devised a new form of federal government for the United States . Following his election as president in 1789 , he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation . He supported Alexander Hamilton 's programs to satisfy all debts , federal and state , established a permanent seat of government , implemented an effective tax system , and created a national bank . In avoiding war with Great Britain , he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795 , despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians . He remained non-partisan , never joining the Federalist Party , although he largely supported its policies . Washington 's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue , warning against partisanship , sectionalism , and involvement in foreign wars . He retired from the presidency in 1797 , returning to his home and plantation at Mount Vernon .   Upon his death , Washington was eulogized as `` first in war , first in peace , and first in the hearts of his countrymen '' by Representative Henry Lee III of Virginia . He was revered in life and in death ; scholarly and public polling consistently ranks him among the top three presidents in American history . He has been depicted and remembered in monuments , public works , currency , and other dedications to the present day . ",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "\n  Roughly three weeks ago the special counsel\u2019s team told Attorney General Bill Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Robert Mueller would not be reaching a conclusion on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice, according to a source familiar with the meeting.   \n\n  The source said that conclusion was \u201cunexpected\u201d and not what Barr had anticipated. \n\n  Barr released a four-page summary on Sunday of Mueller\u2019s principal conclusions, writing that the special counsel \u201cdid not draw a conclusion \u2013 one way or another \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. \u201d\n\n  \u201cInstead,\u201d Barr explained, \u201cfor each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as difficult issues of law and fact concerning whether the President\u2019s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. \u201d\n\n  News of Mueller\u2019s decision to punt on the crucial question of whether the President\u2019s actions amounted to obstruction of justice was particularly notable given that he never received a sit down interview with Trump to assess his state of mind, despite having considered issuing a subpoena for his testimony. \n\n  And whether expected by Justice officials or not, the new timeline now emerging means that Barr had a head start on developing his own analysis on obstruction of justice well before Mueller delivered his confidential report to the attorney general on Friday.  Rosenstein\u2019s office has also been heavily involved in overseeing the investigation since he appointed the special counsel in May 2017. \n\n  Barr explained in his summary to Congress that after reviewing Mueller\u2019s report and consulting with Rosenstein, he concluded that based on the evidence developed during the special counsel\u2019s investigation and federal charging guidelines, the Justice Department couldn\u2019t make a prosecutable case against the President for obstruction.  And that conclusion was reached without regard to the Department\u2019s generally recognized policy of not indicting a sitting president. \n\n  The meeting between Justice officials and the special counsel\u2019s office wasn\u2019t about obstruction alone, the source added, and the special counsel\u2019s team asked for more time to finish their work for administrative reasons, which was granted.  \n\n  Trump and the White House did not know that Mueller had told Barr that he would not come to a conclusion on obstruction, a White House official told CNN Monday night. \n\nThis story has been updated. \n\nCORRECTION: This headline has been updated to reflect that the special counsel\u2019s team told Attorney General Bill Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Robert Mueller would not be reaching a conclusion on obstruction of justice. \n\n  CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report. \n\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.

Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival , along with the live album Live at Leeds , cemented their reputation as a respected rock act . With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend , and the follow-up to Tommy , Lifehouse , was abandoned . Songs from the project made up 1971 's Who 's Next , which included the hit `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again '' . The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots , and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975 . They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976 . The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after .   Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity , releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright . After Townshend became weary of touring , the group split in 1982 . The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985 , a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996 -- 1997 . They resumed regular touring in 1999 , with drummer Zak Starkey . After Entwistle 's death in 2002 , plans for a new album were delayed . Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who , releasing Endless Wire in 2006 , and continued to play live regularly .   The Who 's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack , large PA systems , use of the synthesizer , Entwistle and Moon 's lead playing styles , Townshend 's feedback and power chord guitar technique , and the development of the rock opera . They are cited as an influence by hard rock , punk rock and mod bands , and their songs still receive regular exposure . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "\u201cDr.  Russell Blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick, but they also create serious health risks to the wearer,\u201d a note at the beginning of the May 11, 2020 article says.  \u201cThe bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. \u201dIt has been shared on Facebook more than 24,000 times and tweeted to more than two million followers, according to social media tracking tool CrowdTangle, and also appears on other sites as adapted or re-published content. It was written by Blaylock, whose medical license is currently expired in Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. \u201cIf you are asymptomatic you should wear a mask, and since you can't tell if you are asymptomatic, everyone should wear a mask,\u201d Dr.  Jonathan Karn, director of the Cleveland COVID Task Force, told AFP by email. \u201cIt seems to be an extremely good bet that a cloth mask will limit transmission from asymptomatic people to people in their vicinity,\u201d he said, pointing to a study that found cloth barriers to be beneficial in protecting mice from droplet spread. Karn, of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, also noted that a rigorous population study has yet to be done. Dr.  Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said that by the article\u2019s own admission, an unusual characteristic of COVID-19 is that many carriers are asymptomatic. \u201cWithout very large-scale testing, we don\u2019t know who is infected and who is not,\u201d she said via email. And Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, one of the world's top coronavirus experts, told reporters that \u201cit\u2019s very clear that the effect of masking the infected, especially when they are asymptomatic -- or symptomatic -- it's much more important than anything else. \u201dThe article cites several risks of prolonged use of N95 masks to support the idea that wearing a mask can be problematic. \u201cThe main argument seems to be that N95 respirators can\u2019t be easily worn for long periods of time, which any medical person or researcher knows from personal experience,\u201d Karn said. \u00a0However, N95 masks are explicitly not recommended for the general population by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Karn said. Cloth masks are recommended instead, except for children under age two and people with breathing problems. They \u201cwill not, unfortunately, provide reliable protection against acquisition of infection,\u201d said Karn, but that is not the aim. A face covering \u201cis not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,\u201d the CDC says. The article claims that another risk of face masks is that \u201cthe exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. \u201d\u00a0Karn said that while it is true that the virus can potentially infect neurons and in some cases enter the central nervous system, \u201cit is wrong to say that the virus is trapped by the mask and would then get additionally concentrated in the nasal passages. \u201dThe article is also incorrect in its assertion that this review of 17 studies did not find a conclusive relationship between mask or respirator use and protection against influenza infection, Payne said. \u201cThe conclusion of the review was not that masks are ineffective,\u201d she explained.  Rather, the study -- an analysis last updated in January 2011, years before the novel coronavirus emerged in China -- \u201cpoints out that carefully controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of masks in prevention of influenza have not been conducted. \u201dSome of the studies reviewed indicated that masks can indeed help limit spread of respiratory infections, according to Payne. \u00a0\u201cRetrospective studies of SARS infections, which are caused by a virus that is. . .  more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than is influenza virus, showed lower frequency of SARS among health care workers who consistently wore masks,\u201d she said, while noting that, as the review points out, the studies had relatively small numbers. AFP Fact Check has addressed several other misleading claims about face masks, available here, here and here, and has debunked more than 450 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.

    "evidence": "The company hopes to start vaccinating children before the next school year. Pfizer says vaccine is 100% effective in children ages 12-15Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine is 100% effective against the virus in children ages 12 to 15, the companies announced in a press release Wednesday. In a placebo-controlled trial of 2,260 adolescents, none of the participants who received the real vaccine developed COVID-19, the companies said. Eighteen adolescents who received placebo, or fake, doses became infected with the virus, they said. The COVID-19 vaccine was \"well-tolerated\" by the age group, the companies said, with participants experiencing a similar range of side effects as seen in older teens and young adults. Experts say that ensuring vaccines are safe and effective in children will be crucial to ending the pandemic.  Although children are less likely to die of COVID-19, it\u2019s still possible for them to get sick and spread the virus. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement that he was \"encouraged\" by the clinical trial data, and that the company plans to submit the data to the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration \"in the coming weeks\" to update its emergency use authorization to include children 12 and older. The company hopes to start vaccinating children ages 12 to 15 \"before the start of the next school year,\" Bourla said. Experts say it's important to test vaccines in children to ensure they are safe and effective in the youngest members of society so that ultimately everyone is eligible to receive a potentially lifesaving vaccine. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech launched a global COVID-19 vaccine trial that will ultimately enroll 4,500 children between the ages of 6 months and 11 years old. Their vaccine is currently authorized to be distributed in the U. S.  for use in people ages 16 and up. Other vaccine manufacturers have been moving to offer their vaccines to children.  Moderna announced earlier this month that it would enroll 6,750 children ages 6 months to 12 years old in a clinical trial. Johnson & Johnson also has said it intends to develop trials for children.  Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA for those ages 18 and older.

After 1992 , its planethood was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt . In 2005 , Eris , a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27 % more massive than Pluto , was discovered . This led the International Astronomical Union -LRB- IAU -RRB- to define the term `` planet '' formally in 2006 , during their 26th General Assembly . That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet .   Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun . It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris . Like other Kuiper belt objects , Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small -- about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume . It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU -LRB- 4.4 -- 7.4 billion km -RRB- from the Sun . This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than Neptune , but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding . Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance -LRB- 39.5 AU -RRB- .   Pluto has five known moons : Charon -LRB- the largest , with a diameter just over half that of Pluto -RRB- , Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body .   On July 14 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft became the first spacecraft to fly by Pluto . During its brief flyby , New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons . In September 2016 , astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins , organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life , and produced from methane , nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred about 19,000 km to the orbiting moon .

    "claim": "In their atomic nuclei carbon all has the same number of protons.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei -LRB- i.e. the same atomic number , or Z -RRB- . There are 118 elements that have been identified , of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements . There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes , which decay over time into other elements . Iron is the most abundant element -LRB- by mass -RRB- making up Earth , while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth 's crust .   Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe . However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter makes up only about 15 % of the matter in the universe : the remainder is dark matter ; the composition of this is unknown , but it is not composed of chemical elements .  The two lightest elements , hydrogen and helium , were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe . The next three elements -LRB- lithium , beryllium and boron -RRB- were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation , and are thus rarer than those that follow . Formation of elements with from 6 to 26 protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis . The high abundance of oxygen , silicon , and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars . Elements with greater than 26 protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae , which , when they explode , blast these elements as supernova remnants far into space , where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed .   The term `` element '' is used for atoms with a given number of protons -LRB- regardless of whether or not they are ionized or chemically bonded , e.g. hydrogen in water -RRB- as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element -LRB- e.g. hydrogen gas -RRB- . For the second meaning , the terms `` elementary substance '' and `` simple substance '' have been suggested , but they have not gained much acceptance in English chemical literature , whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used -LRB- e.g. French corps simple , Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e -RRB- . A single element can form multiple substances differing in their structure ; they are called allotropes of the element .   When different elements are chemically combined , with the atoms held together by chemical bonds , they form chemical compounds . Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals . Among the more common of such native elements are copper , silver , gold , carbon -LRB- as coal , graphite , or diamonds -RRB- , and sulfur . All but a few of the most inert elements , such as noble gases and noble metals , are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form , as chemical compounds . While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms , most of these occur as mixtures . For example , atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , and argon , and native solid elements occur in alloys , such as that of iron and nickel .   The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon , sulfur , copper and gold . Later civilizations extracted elemental copper , tin , lead and iron from their ores by smelting , using charcoal . Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more ; almost all of the naturally occurring elements were known by 1900 .   The properties of the chemical elements are summarized in the periodic table , which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows -LRB- `` periods '' -RRB- in which the columns -LRB- `` groups '' -RRB- share recurring -LRB- `` periodic '' -RRB- physical and chemical properties . Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives , all of the elements are available industrially , most of them in low degrees of impurities . , Carbon -LRB- from carbo `` coal '' -RRB- is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6 . It is nonmetallic and tetravalent -- making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds . Three isotopes occur naturally , C and C being stable , while C is a radioactive isotope , decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years . Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity .   Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust , and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium , and oxygen . Carbon 's abundance , its unique diversity of organic compounds , and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life . It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass -LRB- about 18.5 % -RRB- after oxygen .   The atoms of carbon can bond together in different ways , termed allotropes of carbon . The best known are graphite , diamond , and amorphous carbon . The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form . For example , graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent . Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper -LRB- hence its name , from the Greek verb '' \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd '' which means `` to write '' -RRB- , while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known . Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity . Under normal conditions , diamond , carbon nanotubes , and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials . All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions , with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form . They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen .   The most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4 , while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes . The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones , dolomites and carbon dioxide , but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal , peat , oil , and methane clathrates . Carbon forms a vast number of compounds , more than any other element , with almost ten million compounds described to date , and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions . For this reason , carbon has often been referred to as the `` king of the elements '' . , The atomic number or proton number -LRB- symbol Z -RRB- of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom . It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus . The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element . In an uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons .   The atomic number Z , should not be confused with the mass number A , which is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom . This number of neutrons , N , completes the weight : A = Z + N -LRB- all are whole numbers -RRB- . Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass -LRB- and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes -RRB- and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units -LRB- making a quantity called the `` relative isotopic mass '' -RRB- , is roughly -LRB- to within 1 % -RRB- equal to the whole number A.   Atoms with the same atomic number Z but different neutron numbers N , and hence different atomic masses , are known as isotopes . A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes -LRB- see monoisotopic elements -RRB- , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element -LRB- called the relative atomic mass -RRB- in a defined environment on Earth , determines the element 's standard atomic weight . Historically , it was these atomic weights of elements -LRB- in comparison to hydrogen -RRB- that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century .   The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number/numeral/figure , which , prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an element 's numerical place in the periodic table , whose order is approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . Only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word Atomzahl -LRB- and its English equivalent atomic number -RRB- come into common use in this context .

The Giants defeated the Patriots by the score of 21 -- 17 . The game was played on February 5 , 2012 , at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , the first time that the Super Bowl was played in the state of Indiana .   In addition to winning their fourth Super Bowl in team history , the Giants set a new record for the lowest regular season record -LRB- 9 -- 7 , win percentage of 56.3 % -RRB- by a Super Bowl champion . The Patriots entered the game with a 13 -- 3 regular season record , and were also seeking their fourth Super Bowl win . The game was also a rematch of Super Bowl XLII , in which New York also won , 17 -- 14 , to spoil New England 's run at a perfect 2007 season in what is now considered to be one of the greatest upsets in sports history . Super Bowl XLVI also marked the third consecutive matchup between teams from divisions with the same cardinal directions , with the Giants/Patriots from the NFC/AFC East , Super Bowl XLV between the Green Bay Packers/Pittsburgh Steelers from the NFC/AFC North , and Super Bowl XLIV between the New Orleans Saints/Indianapolis Colts from the NFC/AFC South . Two years later , the Seattle Seahawks/Denver Broncos , from the NFC/AFC West , would continue this trend when they met each other for Super Bowl XLVIII .   The Giants jumped to a 9 -- 0 lead in the first quarter of Super Bowl XLVI before the Patriots scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17 -- 9 lead in the third quarter . But the Giants prevented the Patriots from scoring again , and two consecutive New York field goals chipped away New England 's lead , 17 -- 15 , late in the third quarter . The Giants capped off an 88-yard drive with running back Ahmad Bradshaw 's 6-yard game-winning touchdown with 57 seconds left in the game . Eli Manning , who completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards , one touchdown , and no interceptions , was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career . He became the third consecutive quarterback to win the award after Aaron Rodgers in Super Bowl XLV and Drew Brees in Super Bowl XLIV .   The broadcast of the game on NBC broke the then record for the most-watched program in American television history , previously set during the previous year 's Super Bowl . Super Bowl XLVI was watched by an estimated average audience of 111.3 million US viewers and an estimated total audience of 166.8 million , according to Nielsen , meaning that over half of the American population watched at least some of the initial broadcast . The game also set the record for most tweets per second during a sporting event , with 13.7 million tweets from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. -LRB- PST -RRB- . ",

Fire nearly destroys Notre Dame CathedralA fire has engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, one of the city's most iconic sights. The fire began at 6:50 p. m.  local time Monday, the Paris fire department said, and continued to burn hours later. A French firefighter official told reporters the main structure of the cathedral has been saved and the two iconic main towers are intact and have been saved as well. French Mayor Anne Hidalgo said that authorities were evacuating people from buildings in the area -- including homes close to the cathedral. A spokesperson for the cathedral described the damage to French media as \"colossal. \"\"Everything is burning, nothing will remain from the frame,\" the spokesperson said. First responders are currently trying to salvage priceless art stored inside the cathedral, said Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire.  Last week, the statues of the apostles were removed for restoration, The Associated Press reported. Images on social media show smoke and flames shooting from the top of Notre Dame as massive plumes of smoke billow into the sky above. One video shows a spire toppling over as a result of the flames. The fire may be connected to the recent restoration of the church, officials said.  The restoration work costs 120 million euros, the Notre Dame Paris office told ABC News, adding that a fire alarm test conducted last week went well. The roof has completely collapsed, witness John Dickas, an American professor living in Paris, told ABC News. Large crowds have begun to gather around the scene.  Some members of the crowd began to sing hymns as the cathedral burned. The cathedral was built around 1260 AD and towered over the city of Paris for centuries.  Much of the facade and interior are true to their original designs. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed sadness at the sight of the historic building's demise, saying it captures the \"emotion of an entire nation. \"\"Thinking of all the Catholics and all the French people,\" Macron wrote.  \"Like all of our countrymen, I am sad tonight to see part of us burning. \"Monday is the start of Holy Week, the busiest and most important period of the liturgical year.  Easter is on Sunday. American Kelly Weymouth, who is currently studying abroad in Paris, said she was taking a sunset cruise on the Seine river with her mother when the fire broke out. At one point, as the traffic on the river was stopped, Weymouth and about 40 fellow passengers from all over the world watched in horror for about 45 minutes as the fire destroyed the cathedral, she said. The Frenchmen who were on the boat began to sob and embrace each other, Weymouth said, describing the moment as \"very intense. \"\"We express our closeness to French Catholics and the Parisians and assure them of our prayers for the firefighters and all those that are doing everything possible to fight this dramatic situation,\" the statement read. \"If it collapses, you can imagine how important the damage will be,\" Gallet said. Around 500 firefighters were involved in helping to put out the fire, Macron said. \"The worst was avoided even if the battle has not been completely won,\" Macron said, vowing to rebuild the historic structure by utilizing \"the best talents. \"ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Kirit Radia contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "evidence": "Gerald Rudolph Ford , Jr. -LRB- born Leslie Lynch King , Jr. ; July 14 , 1913 -- December 26 , 2006 -RRB- was an American politician who served as the 38th President of the United States from 1974 to 1977 , following the resignation of Richard Nixon . Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States , following the resignation of Spiro Agnew . He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment , and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office . Before his appointment to the vice presidency , Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan 's 5th congressional district , the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader .   As President , Ford signed the Helsinki Accords , marking a move toward d\u00e9tente in the Cold War . With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency , U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended . Domestically , Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression , with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure . One of his most controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal . During Ford 's presidency , foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play , and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President . In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976 , Ford defeated former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination . He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger , former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , making him the first President who succeeded to office as a result of a mid-term vacancy since Chester A. Arthur not to be elected in his own right .   Following his years as President , Ford remained active in the Republican Party . After experiencing health problems , he died at home on December 26 , 2006 . Ford lived longer than any other U.S. president -- 93 years and 165 days -- while his 895-day presidency was the shortest of all presidents who did not die in office . ",

    "evidence": "Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, this week. NBA postpones all games after players refuse to play over Jacob Blake shootingThe NBA announced Wednesday it chose to postpone all three playoff games scheduled for the day after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to play their Game 5 against the Orlando Magic and other teams appeared likely to follow suit. The Bucks decided not to take the court for Game 5 of their series against the Orlando Magic over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, earlier this week, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. \"The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association today announced that in light of the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 decision to not take the floor today for Game 5 against the Orlando Magic, today\u2019s three games -- Bucks vs.  Magic, Houston Rockets vs.  Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Lakers vs.  Portland Trail Blazers -- have been postponed,\" the NBA said in a statement.  \"Game 5 of each series will be rescheduled. \"The WNBA announced its three regular season games Wednesday -- being held at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida -- would also be postponed. The MLB's Milwaukee Brewers also announced they will not play their game against the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday, according to ESPN.  The Seattle Mariners, the roster with the league's highest number of Black players, also said it would not play against the San Diego Padres.  The Los Angeles Dodgers vs.  San Francisco Giants game was also postponed. Blake, who was unarmed, was shot seven times in the back by police after leaning into his car and is paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family.  The shooting has caused violent protests in Kenosha the last three nights.  Two people were killed in shootings during protests on Tuesday night. The Kenosha Police Department and FBI have said they are investigating the shooting. \"The past four months have shed a light on the ongoing racial injustices facing our African American communities,\" Bucks guard Sterling Brown said, reading a statement after the team chose not to play.  \"Citizens around the country have used their voices and platforms to speak out against these wrongdoings.  Over the last few days in our home state of Wisconsin, we've seen the horrendous video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back seven times by a police officer in Kenosha, and the additional shooting of protesters.  Despite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action, so our focus today cannot be on basketball. \"The Bucks lead the series 3-1, and were scheduled to play Game 5 at 4 p. m.  on Wednesday. \"Some things are bigger than basketball,\" Bucks Senior Vice President Alex Lasry tweeted.  \"The stand taken today by the players and org shows that we\u2019re fed up.  Enough is enough.  Change needs to happen.  I\u2019m incredibly proud of our guys and we stand 100% behind our players ready to assist and bring about real change. \"The Magic said it supported not playing as well. \"Today we stand united with the NBA Office, the National Basketball Players Association, the Milwaukee Bucks and the rest of the league condemning bigotry, racial injustice and the unwarranted use of violence by police against people of color,\" the team said in a statement. The Lakers lead their series 3-1 over Portland and the Thunder and Rockets are tied at 2-2.  Three games are also scheduled for Thursday.  No announcement has been made on whether they will be played. All three games Wednesday were to be played at the Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida, where the NBA is conducting its playoffs due to COVID-19. Milwaukee is the No.  1 seed in the Eastern Conference in the NBA playoffs.  They lost Game 1, but have won three straight games.  The team features Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA MVP, who was named defensive player of the year on Wednesday. In an interview with The Undefeated, Bucks guard George Hill said, \"We\u2019re tired of the killings and the injustice. \"The Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors, who open their second-round playoff series on Thursday, have also discussed a boycott, according to Raptors head coach Nick Nurse. \"Boycotting the game has come up for them as a way to try to demand a little more action,\" Nurse said Wednesday, prior to the Bucks' announced boycott.  \"That's really what they want.  I think there's enough attention and not quite enough action, and that's what I can sense from the discussions, is their disappointment.  Like, 'Man, how can we get something to change, like now? ' We need something to change, not just attention on the problem.  We need a plan of action. \"Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell tweeted \"WE DEMAND CHANGE!  SALUTE @Bucks\" in response to the shooting. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James tweeted similarly, adding an expletive and saying, \"WE DEMAND CHANGE.  SICK OF IT. \"Presidential contender Joe Biden also tweeted, supporting the players' decisions. \"This moment demands moral leadership.  And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good.  Now is not the time for silence,\" Biden tweeted Wednesday evening, linking to a video of the Bucks players reading their statement earlier tonight.

    "evidence": "AC/DC are an Australian rock band , formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young . A hard rock/blues rock band , they have also been considered a heavy metal band , although they have always dubbed their music simply `` rock and roll '' .   AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album , High Voltage , in 1975 . Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage . Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell , lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption . The group considered disbanding , but buoyed by support from Scott 's parents , decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist . Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott . Later that year , the band released the new album , Back in Black , which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott . The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller .   The band 's next album , For Those About to Rock We Salute You , was their first album to reach number one in the United States . Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright , who left to join Dio in 1989 . The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge . Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade , who was with the band from 1989 to 1994 , was asked to leave in favour of him , and contributed to the band 's 1995 album Ballbreaker . Stiff Upper Lip , released in 2000 , was well received by critics . The band 's studio album , Black Ice , released in 2008 , was the second-highest-selling album of that year , and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock , eventually reaching No. 1 on all charts worldwide . The band 's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young 's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd 's legal troubles . In 2016 , Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N ' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band 's vocalist for the remainder of that year 's dates . Long-term bass player Cliff Williams retired from the band at the end of their 2016 Rock Or Bust world tour .   AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide , including 71.5 million albums in the United States , adding them to the list of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the list of best-selling music artists . Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide , making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist -- and the highest-selling album by any band . The album has sold 22 million units in the US , where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time . AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1 's list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock '' and were named the seventh `` Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time '' by MTV . In 2004 , AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' . Producer Rick Rubin , who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list , referred to AC/DC as `` the greatest rock and roll band of all time '' . In 2010 , AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the `` 100 Greatest Artists of All Time '' . ",

    "evidence": "The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has put up posters in the state\u2019s Aurangabad city announcing cash reward to those who can give information on illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi infiltrators. The Raj Thackeray-led MNS said in the posters that anyone providing information about alleged infiltrators from Pakistan and Bangladesh will receive Rs 5000.  The MNS refers to Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar.  Thackeray, who recently shifted to \u2018Hindutva\u2019 from his earlier \u2018Marathi Manoos\u2019 plank, has been looking to gain ground in Aurangabad which has been the citadel of the MNS\u2019s arch-rival, the Shiv Sena.  The party chief led a rally demanding the expulsion of Bangladeshi and Pakistani infiltrators in Mumbai earlier this month.  It was the first rally by Thackeray after he steered the MNS towards a hardline Hindutva and changed the party flag. Raj Thackeray has also come out strongly in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The MNS\u2019 Pune unit had also launched a campaign to weed out Bangladeshis living illegally in the city. The MNS has been going through a rough phase since 2014 as it lost power in the Nashik Municipal Corporation and its tally in the Maharastra assembly came down to just one in both the 2014 and 2019 polls, from 13 in the 2009 polls.  After embracing the Hindutva ideology, Thackeray has reportedly started to grow close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against which he had run a campaign in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls last year.

Luxembourg , which is significantly larger than the European microstates , nonetheless also shares some of these characteristics .   Some scholars dispute the status of Vatican City as a state , arguing that it does not meet the `` traditional criteria of statehood '' and that the `` special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions , and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations .

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film , produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film . The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by William Shakespeare 's Hamlet . The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance . The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff , produced by Don Hahn , and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts , and Linda Woolverton . Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice , and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer . The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick , James Earl Jones , Jeremy Irons , Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Moira Kelly , Nathan Lane , Ernie Sabella , Rowan Atkinson , Robert Guillaume , Madge Sinclair , Whoopi Goldberg , Cheech Marin , and Jim Cummings .   The Lion King tells the story of Simba , a young lion who is to succeed his father , Mufasa , as King of the Pride Lands ; however , after Simba 's uncle Scar murders Mufasa , Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile . Upon maturation living with two wastrels , Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend , Nala , and his shaman , Rafiki , before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King .   Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg , Roy E. Disney , and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe . Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment , and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director , being later joined by Allers . Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas , which wound up attracting most of Disney 's top animators . Some time after the staff traveled to Hell 's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film 's setting and animals , Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical and was replaced by Minkoff . When Hahn joined the project , he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten . Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida . Computer animation was also used in several scenes , most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence .   The Lion King was released on June 15 , 1994 , to a positive reaction from critics , who praised the film for its music , story , and animation ; it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing release of 1994 and the second highest-grossing film of all time . The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy . The film has led to many derived works , such as a Broadway adaptation ; two direct-to-video follow-ups -- the sequel , The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , and the prequel/parallel , The Lion King 1 1/2 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- -- ; two television series , Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard ; and a 3D re-release , in 2011 .   In 2016 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .   A CGI live-action remake of the film is scheduled for a July 19 , 2019 release in the United States . ",

    "evidence": "At least 14 people have died in the latest round of seasonal rains and flooding in southern China, as soldiers and workers built makeshift barriers with sandbags and rocks Saturday to keep the Yangtze River and its tributaries at bay.Three floodgates of the Three Gorges Dam that spans the Yangtze were opened as the water level behind the massive dam rose more than 15 meters (50 feet) above flood level, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.The dam was holding back about 45% of the water, Xinhua said, citing China Three Gorges Corp.Upstream, 11 people had been killed in Chongqing as of Saturday morning, China National Emergency Broadcasting said in an online report, citing the municipal emergency agency. More than 20,000 people had been evacuated and 1,031 homes destroyed.Three landslides in Dunhao town in a mountainous part of Chongqing left six dead, the city\u2019s Emergency Management Bureau said. The bodies had been found by Friday evening after more than 200 people were dispatched for a search and rescue operation. Rainfall in the town of Dunhao totaled 39 centimeters (15 inches), the bureau said.Three more people died in neighboring Hubei province, the emergency management department said in a social media post.State broadcaster CCTV showed people cleaning up still wet, muddy streets and shops in the city of Enshi after severe flooding Friday. Rescue workers used inflatable rafts to rescue more than 1,900 people trapped in their homes and other buildings.Downriver, firefighters and others finished filling in a 188-meter (620-foot) break in a dike on Poyang Lake, China\u2019s largest freshwater lake, Xinhua said.The dike gave way nine days ago, flooding 15 villages and agricultural fields in Jiangxi province, the news agency said. More than 14,000 people were evacuated.The incoming waters were expected to peak Saturday behind the Three Gorges Dam, but more water is forecast to arrive around Tuesday, Xinhua said. The hydropower dam is used to mitigate catastrophic flooding.Seasonal flooding strikes large parts of China annually, especially in its central and southern regions, but the rainfall has been unusually high this year.About 1.8 million people have been evacuated and direct losses attributed to flooding are estimated at more than 49 billion yuan ($7 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.Major cities have been spared so far, but concern has risen over Wuhan and other downstream metropolises that are home to tens of millions of people.China\u2019s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

    "evidence": "An infographic titled \u2013 \u2018Risk of Community Transmission of COVID-19\u2019 is being shared on social media with a claim that the Telangana State has COVID-19 community transmission risk of 122%. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. The formula used to calculate the community transmission risk has no scientific basis. Also, the numbers used for calculation are reportedly taken from the Aarogya Setu app which is not used by everybody. While the number of people in containment zones in Telangana currently stands at 1,99,465, the quarantine number taken for calculating the Telangana COVID-19 transmission risk is just around 3000. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When searched for the profile \u2018@india. in. pixels\u2019, it was found that the Facebook page \u2013 \u2018India in Pixels\u2019 has posted (archived) the same infographic on their page on 22 June 2020. But, it can be seen that they have made an edit to their post and added that \u2013 \u2018Please do not panic based on this infographic, it is not making a prediction but only comparing the number of quarantined people in comparison with active cases. For Delhi and Telangana, this ratio is higher compared to other states based on the Aarogya Setu app. A value above 100 means there are more people active than people quarantined which means they need to increase the quarantining of people \u2013 that\u2019s it. We are not making any claim on the spread \u2013 which will depend upon population simulations. The infographic has been circulated without the context and people from different sides appropriating it to suit their narrative. \u2019 The clarifications issued by @indiainpixels on their twitter can be seen here and here. Also, a GitHub link to the data used for calculations is given in the post. On looking at the data, it can be found that the number of quarantined people taken for calculating the risk for Telangana is just around 3000. In the press note issued by the Telangana government, it can be seen that the number of people in the containment zones at present is 1,99,465 i. e. around 60 times more than the number used for calculation. Also, there is no scientific basis for the formula used for calculating the risk of community transmission. In one of its comments, the \u2018India in Pixels\u2019 itself mentioned \u2013 \u2018the metric is super rough. While a more perfect metric can be made considering population density and testing parameters, it will be far too complex to be visualized. This metric is simple to understand but is arguably rough. \u2019 Even if consider the formula as a metric to calculate the community transmission risk, with the numbers given by the Telangana government (not as reported from Aarogya Setu app), the risk for Telangana comes just around 2. 2%. (with data as on 22 June 2020)To sum it up, a random formula and questionable data are taken to show Telangana has COVID-19 community transmission risk of 122%. Did you watch our new video?",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "The Centre on Wednesday decided to withdraw 100 companies (around 10,000 personnel) of central paramilitary forces from Jammu and Kashmir after a security review, officials familiar with the development said. They said the decision was taken as a large number of troops were deployed in the valley for more than one and a half years now who needed to be rested. Significantly, the security situation in the valley has improved and terrorists are on the back foot, the officers said. On Wednesday, 40 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and 20 each of the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) were withdrawn by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and were asked to report back to their respective locations. Earlier, the MHA had withdrawn around 82 companies in December last year. The security grid in J-K was strengthened with an additional 600 odd companies (around 60,000 troops) rushed there just ahead of the government\u2019s decision to withdraw the special status of J-K and bifurcate it into two union territories on August 5, 2019. These troops were stationed at various locations from where terrorist incidents, stone pelting incidents were reported. According to the latest government data, stone pelting incidents have drastically reduced this year as compared to 2019 or 2018. In 2018, there were 532 incidents of stone pelting in Kashmir, 389 in 2019 but only 102 such incidents were reported this year so far. Senior officers deployed in the valley have claimed that the locals don\u2019t disrupt the counter-terror operations anymore and there is more support from the public in general. With the latest decision, around 400 additional companies of paramilitary forces are still deployed in J-K in additional to CRPF\u2019s regular 67 battalions (around 67,000 personnel) and army and the J-K police.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Skunks are notorious for their anal scent glands, which they can use as a defensive weapon. They are similar to, though much more developed than, the glands found in species of the family Mustelidae. Skunks have two glands, one on each side of the anus. These glands produce the skunk's spray, which is a mixture of sulfur-containing chemicals such as thiols (traditionally called mercaptans), which have an offensive odor. A skunk's spray is powerful enough to ward off bears and other potential attackers. Muscles located next to the scent glands allow them to spray with a high degree of accuracy, as far as . The smell aside, the spray can cause irritation and even temporary blindness, and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by a human nose up to 5.6 km (3.5 miles) downwind. Their chemical defense is effective, as illustrated by this extract from Charles Darwin's \"Voyage of the Beagle\":BULLET::::- Skunk (voiced by Jules de Jongh) \u2013 The main character of the series. Skunk is the youngest of the valley dwellers and wants to be a Kung Fu master but he has to learn his Kung Fu moves with Panda first. He is very eager to have a crush on Princess Prettyhead but he is often unwilling to work towards his goal. Skunk can sometimes be lazy and impatient. However, when he puts his mind to it Skunk can accomplish a lot going through a lot to achieve the goal he is set. Skunk is very trusting of his friends even Rabbit who doesn't always treat Skunk with respect. Rather than concentrating on his lessons Skunk tries to find the \"easy way out\". However, these plans usually backfire forcing Skunk to figure a way out of his problem learning the lesson he was initially trying to avoid. Despite being lazy and sometimes mischievous Skunk is an overall good individual who cares about his friends and usually tries to do the right thing. He also has a unique defense mechanism in which he sprays a green and smelly gas unlike an actual skunk which sprays a stinky amber colored liquid. This usually happens when he is embarrassed scared or suddenly surprised. Though it is effective Skunk himself is greatly embarrassed by this power. He has also stated that he's incapable of doing it at will unlike real skunks. Sometimes Skunk goes on missions that don't need him, which causes disaster. He usually calls himself \"Princess Prettyhead herself\" when he is bigger than his enemies or when on a large contraption. He was given to Panda by Heaven when Panda asked for help against Dragon, hinting he has a larger destiny than he's aware of. He also seems to be the only one aware of Rabbit's crush on Fox.",

His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old .   Capone was born in Brooklyn in New York City to Italian immigrants . He was considered a Five Points Gang member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels . In his early twenties , he moved to Chicago and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio , head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol -- the forerunner of the Outfit -- and that was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana . A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in Capone 's rise and fall . Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him , handing control to Capone . Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means , but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city 's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement .   Capone apparently reveled in attention , such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games . He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a `` modern-day Robin Hood '' . However , the Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre of gang rivals , resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight , damaged Chicago 's image -- as well as Capone 's -- leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him `` Public Enemy No. 1 '' .   The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone , and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931 , a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era . During the highly publicized case , the judge admitted as evidence Capone 's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior -LRB- and ultimately abortive -RRB- negotiations to pay the government any back taxes he owed . Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison . After conviction , he replaced his old defense team with experts in tax law , and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a Supreme Court ruling , but his appeal ultimately failed .   He was already showing signs of syphilitic dementia early in his sentence , and he became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years . On January 25 , 1947 , Capone died of cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke . ",

In 1991 , his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team resulted in Schumacher being signed by Benetton Formula One team as their driver for the rest of that season . Establishing himself as a top driver , finishing third in 1992 and fourth in 1993 , Schumacher became the first German World Drivers ' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill . In 1995 he repeated the success , this time with a greater margin . Schumacher moved to Ferrari in 1996 . Schumacher came close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles , before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix , ending another title run . Schumacher won five consecutive drivers ' titles from 2000 to 2004 . Schumacher retired from Formula One driving in 2006 staying with Ferrari as an advisor . He came close to an eighth title that year , but due to technical problems in the final two races he fell short to Fernando Alonso . Schumacher agreed to return for Ferrari part-way through 2009 , as cover for the badly injured Felipe Massa , but was prevented by a neck injury . Schumacher returned to Formula One on a permanent basis from 2010 with the Mercedes team before retiring for a second time at the conclusion of the 2012 season .   His career was not without controversy , including being twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that determined the outcome of the World Championship , with Damon Hill in 1994 in Adelaide , and with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 in Jerez . Off the track , Schumacher is an ambassador for UNESCO and a spokesman for driver safety . He has been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts throughout his life and donated tens of millions of dollars to charity . Schumacher and his younger brother , Ralf , are the only brothers to win races in Formula One , and they were the first brothers to finish 1st and 2nd in the same race , a feat they repeated in four subsequent races .   In December 2013 , Schumacher suffered a serious head injury in a skiing accident . He was airlifted to a hospital and placed in a medically induced coma , having suffered a traumatic brain injury . He was in the coma for six months from 29 December 2013 until 16 June 2014 . He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital -LRB- CHUV -RRB- in Lausanne . On 9 September 2014 , Schumacher was relocated to his home where he continues to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately . ",

    "claim": "A meme showing a mug shot of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz suggests that the congressman has had \u201cseven DUIs\u201d and is responsible for the \u201csuspicious\u201d death of his college roommate.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The image used in the meme is a genuine mugshot from Matt Gaetz\u2019s October 2008 DUI arrest (but he was never convicted in connection with that arrest). Claims of \u201cseven DUIs\u201d and a \u201csuspicious\u201d college roommate death have their origin in a post by conspiracy theorist Wayne Madsen and remain wholly unverified. Memes peddling false political claims often work best when they sprinkle a pinch of fact into their misinformation stew. That appears to be the strategy employed in memes making use of U.S. congressman Matt Gaetz\u2019s mug shot from a 2008 DUI arrest:  The fact blended into these memes\u2019 fictions is that a mug shot stemming from Gaetz\u2019s arrest for driving under the influence is real, as has been acknowledged by the congressman himself and was reported by the Tampa Bay Times in 2014: A controversy ensued when charges against Gaetz, whose father was a member of the Florida State Senate at the time, were dropped and his license was reinstated. This occurred despite a Florida law requiring a year-long suspension for refusing to take a breathalyzer test. According to the Tampa Bay Times, \u201cA field officer for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breath test. Yet the refusal was clearly documented in [the arresting officer\u2019s] affidavit and arrest report.\u201d The arresting officer, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin, resigned a month after the Gaetz arrest under pressure from his superiors, who cited disciplinary issues. The question of whether Gaetz\u2019s father\u2019s political connections played an improper role in these outcomes has dogged Gaetz for years. Gaetz, for his part, has dismissed such allegations as \u201ctabloid journalism.\u201d In terms of what is accessible via public records, the 2008 arrest is Gaetz\u2019s only recorded DUI. Despite that, several memes and articles make the claim that Gaetz has had at least seven DUI arrests. The earliest iteration of this claim appears to stem from an August 29, 2016, post written by conspiracy theorist Wayne Madsen, who stated: \u201cMatt Gaetz, currently a member of the Florida House of Representatives, portrays himself to the Bible-thumping voters of the Panhandle as a God-fearing conservative. However, even a partial glance at Gaetz\u2019s record reveals at least seven arrests for drunk driving and a reputed alternate gay life style. Gaetz\u2019s politically powerful father Don ensured that none of the arrests led to prosecutions.\u201d Madsen provided no hint as to the location or nature of these purported records. We reached out to Madsen via his website to ask if he could provide any documentary evidence for these claims but did not receive a response. A criminal record produced by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, whom we queried on July 3, 2019, showed only one DUI arrest, but such a report would not include offenses from other states:  Public records searches performed by Snopes in other jurisdictions did not turn up any additional DUI arrests. Another bit of a fact sprinkled into this claim is that Gaetz does have a prolific record of traffic violations. A 2014 investigation conducted by northern Florida newspaper TCPalm tracked the driving records of hundreds of Florida state politicians. Matt Gaetz, with 16 speeding tickets between 1999 and 2014, was among the most frequently cited lawmakers. Mentions of a \u201csuspicious\u201d death of Gaetz\u2019s roommate during his four years at Florida State University between 1999 and 2003, like the claims of seven DUIs, did not exist online prior to Madsen\u2019s August 2016 piece, in which he stated: Madsen\u2019s being the only source for this claim merits suspicion on its own: He has a history of making wholly baseless claims without evidence. A prominent proponent of the claim that former President Obama is not a U.S. citizen, he has, for example, falsely claimed that Barack Obama had \u201chomosexual trysts\u201d with Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Senate majority leader Bill Frist (among others), and Madsen is the author of a self-published book asserting that Obama\u2019s rise to the White House was engineered by the CIA. Not only is the suspicious \u201croommate death\u201d claim flawed, but further doubt is cast on its veracity by the fact that we have been unable to identify any contemporaneous press accounts of suspicious deaths of a Florida State University student who could possibly have been a Gaetz roommate between 1999 and 2003. Though an administrator at Florida State University confirmed to us that roughly 30 students with expected graduations between 1999 and 2003 passed away during that time period, we found nothing publicly suggesting a Gaetz link to any case that received press coverage. As such, we consider the claim without merit. While the mug shot and 2008 DUI arrest are true, additional elements of this brand of Matt Gaetz meme appears to be sourced solely from the imagination of a conspiracy theorist.

    "claim": "It is illegal to have more than two dildos in a home in Arizona.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Does Arizona have a law limiting the number of dildos a person can have in their home? That rumor has been bouncing around blogs, books, and websites for decades. In December 2018, a Twitter user  renewed interest in this suspiciously strange piece of legislation:  This restriction is not actually codified in Arizona law. But it almost was. Arizona State Rep. Leslie Johnson (R-Mesa) attempted to pass an obscenity law in the 1980s aimed at regulating pornography and banning the sale of dildos. House Bill 2613, which was later dubbed the \u201cdildo bill,\u201d would have made the commercial sale of \u201cobscene devices,\u201d such as dildos, a felony. The first news report we could find covering the bill was published in the Arizona Daily Star in December 1987:  The original proposal focused only on the sale of \u201cobscene devices\u201d and not their ownership. Alan Sears, the lawyer who drafted the bill for Johnson, said that ownership of such devices was less important as women didn\u2019t like using them anyway. However, a provision of the proposed bill stated that ownership of six or more dildos would be considered proof of intent to sell them commercially \u2014 which would have made such ownership a felony. While the bill faced some ridicule from members of the public (some Arizonans reportedly sported bumper stickers reading, \u201cWhen dildos are outlawed, only outlaws will have dildos\u201d), it was eventually passed by both the House and Senate. Ultimately, however, Gov. Rose Mofford vetoed the measure. Dildo ownership, however, was not at the center of Mofford\u2019s decision to veto the bill. The then-Arizona governor\u2019s action was based more on the term \u201cobscenity,\u201d how it was defined, and how it would be enforced: Johnson, who insisted that dildos were used solely to abuse children, filed similar legislation the following year. When the Arizona House amended some of the language in the bill, replacing the word \u201cdildo\u201d with \u201cchild molestation devices,\u201d Johnson killed the legislation: The story behind Johnson\u2019s obscenity law was eventually boiled down to a factually inaccurate sentence published on the website Dumblaws circa 1999. From there, it spread to a number of listicles concerning \u201cobscure laws\u201d in the United States. Perhaps most famously, photographer Olivia Locher created a visual representation of this rumor in her 2017 book I Fought the Law:  Despite the widespread prevalence of the rumor, no law on the books in Arizona prohibits the number of dildos a person can own. The rumor stemmed from a failed piece of 1989 legislation dubbed the \u201cdildo bill\u201d which, among other things, would have made it a felony to sell sex toys. The \u201cownership\u201d aspect of the rumor was due to language in the bill stating that owning more than six (not two) dildos would have constituted proof of intent to distribute. The Phoenix New Times reported on the legislation (and several other fabled Arizona statutes) in 2013 and asserted that Arizonans \u201ccan have dildos stacked to the rafters\u201d without fear of legal repercussions.

On 02 July 2020, eight police personnel including a Deputy Superintendent of Police and 3 Sub-Inspectors were killed in a violent face-off with a group who work under a gangster Vikas Dubey in Kanpur. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post. A gangster with the same name Vikas Dubey, is the one who is accused of killing 8 policemen in Kanpur, not the BJP Leader Vikas Dubey. When his photo went viral on social media alleging him to be that accused criminal, the BJP leader clarified that he is not the person who was involved in that encounter. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When we searched for relevant information related to the encounter that took place on 02 July in Kanpur, we found a article related to that incident in Jagran website. The article had the photo of the accused Vikas Dubey. It is understood that the accused was not the BJP leader Vikas Dubey but, a notorious criminal who shares the same name Vikas Dubey. The accused Vikas Dubey joined Bahujan Samaj party (BSP) earlier. He is a history-sheeter facing 60 criminal cases . BJP leader Vikas Dubey clarified the same through a video when his photo went viral on social media alleging him to be the one accused of killing 8 police personnel in the Kanpur encounter. An article about his clarification could be seen here. On 02 July 2020, a team of 15 to 16 police personnel had gone to raid an area in search of criminal Vikas Dubey in Chaubepur village in Kanpur. As the police team reached the spot, they were ambushed by Dubey\u2019s men who were well prepared with arms. A total of 8 police personnel including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, 3 Sub-Inspectors died in that encounter. To sum it up, BJP leader Vikas Dubey is falsely portrayed as accused criminal Vikas Dubey, who killed 8 Uttar Pradesh police personnel in an encounter at Kanpur. Did you watch our new video?",

We are yet to identify the dead and the injured. We are searching for the factory owner,\u201d said Dhrubajyoti De, deputy commissioner (headquarter) of Barrackpore. Such was the intensity of the blast that tremors were felt in houses located at least two to three kilometres from the blast spot. Bharatiya Janata Party MP Arjun Singh demanded a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) saying that the factory could have terror links. \u201cI visited the spot after the blast. There are several such illegal factories in the area. But they actually manufacture crude bombs under the garb of firecrackers.

    "evidence": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun , orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days . It has the longest rotation period -LRB- 243 days -RRB- of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets . It has no natural satellites . It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty . It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon , reaching an apparent magnitude of \u2212 4.6 , bright enough to cast shadows at night and , though rare , occasionally be visible in broad daylight . Because Venus orbits within Earth 's orbit it is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun ; its maximum angular distance from the Sun -LRB- elongation -RRB- is 47.8 \u00b0 .   Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth 's `` sister planet '' because of their similar size , mass , proximity to the Sun , and bulk composition . It is radically different from Earth in other respects . It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets , consisting of more than 96 % carbon dioxide . The atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of Earth , or roughly the pressure found 900 m underwater on Earth . Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System , with a mean surface temperature of 735 K , even though Mercury is closer to the Sun . Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid , preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light . It may have had water oceans in the past , but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect . The water has probably photodissociated , and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field . Venus 's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism .   As one of the brightest objects in the sky , Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed . It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures , and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the `` morning star '' and `` evening star '' . Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky , as early as the second millennium BC .   As the closest planet to Earth , Venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration . It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft -LRB- Mariner 2 in 1962 -RRB- , and the first to be successfully landed on -LRB- by Venera 7 in 1970 -RRB- . Venus 's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light , and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991 . Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions , but they are hindered by Venus 's hostile surface conditions . ",

Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War , and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the Soviet Union . He was a member of the Democratic Party who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate prior to becoming president .   Kennedy was born in Brookline , Massachusetts to Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. and Rose Kennedy . A scion of the Kennedy family , he graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the United States Naval Reserve the following year . During World War II , Kennedy commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service . After the war , Kennedy represented Massachusetts 's 11th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 until 1953 . He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960 . While serving in the Senate , he published Profiles in Courage , which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography . In the 1960 presidential election , Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon , who was the incumbent Vice President .   Kennedy 's time in office was marked by high tensions with Communist states in the Cold War . He increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam by a factor of 18 over President Dwight D. Eisenhower . In April 1961 , he authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion . He subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba . In October 1962 , U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba ; the resulting period of tensions , termed the Cuban Missile Crisis , nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict . Domestically , Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps and supported the Civil Rights Movement , but he was largely unsuccessful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies . Kennedy continues to rank highly in historians ' polls of U.S. presidents and with the general public . His average approval rating of 70 % is the highest of any president in Gallup 's history of systematically measuring job approval .   On November 22 , 1963 , Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas . Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the crime , but he was never prosecuted due to his murder by Jack Ruby two days later . Pursuant to the Presidential Succession Act , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president later that day . The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin , but various groups believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy . After Kennedy 's death , many of his proposals were enacted , including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964 . ",

Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut \"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\" and continued this sound through their second album \"Waking the Fallen\". However, Avenged Sevenfold's style had evolved by the band's third album and first major label release, \"City of Evil\", into a heavy metal and hard rock style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James \"The Rev\" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and released and toured in support of its fifth album \"Nightmare\" in 2010, which debuted on the top spot of the \"Billboard\" 200, Avenged Sevenfold's first number one debut. In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. Avenged Sevenfold's sixth studio album \"Hail to the King\", which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Arin Ilejay. \"Hail to the King\" charted as number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change wasn't announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled \"The Stage\" on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in the US. \"The Stage\" is their first conceptual album and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards the progressive metal sound.Despite the mixed reaction, the album won a \"Kerrang!\" Award for Best Album in 2008.\n\nThe USC Trojans Marching Band performed the song \"Almost Easy\" at the Rose Bowl halftime show on January 1, 2009.\n\nSection::::Track listing.\n\nAll songs credited to Avenged Sevenfold.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "BJP's Information Technology Cell chief (IT Cell) Amit Malviya, has dedicatedly spewed fake news over and over again.   On Tuesday, even as the counting of votes continued, Malviya, tweeted an OpIndia story titled 'Shaheen Bagh protest site seen empty as AAP all set to return in Delhi' AAP won election and Shaheen Bagh protestors have gone home. . .  https://t. co/Kv4xXL57FC This tweet has been further retweeted more than 3,000 times.   In their article, right-wing website OpIndia has said, \"On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with a scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. \" The article also notes that \"that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory.  \"  Amar Ujala had earlier in the day published the same story with the title \"\u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0917 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0927\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0938\u094d\u0925\u0932 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0938\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u091f\u093e, \u0916\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092a\u0902\u0921\u093e\u0932\" (Shaheen Bagh protest site now empty).  Swarajya, another right-wing magazine, also published an article on similar lines, titled, \"Shaheen Bagh Protest Site Virtually Empty On Election Result Morning As AAP Notches Decisive Victory: Report\" The claim has also been shared widely on social media.    Following AAP's victory in Delhi Assembly elections(2020), the protesters at Shaheen Bagh didn't show up.    The photos were clicked before the protestors had assembled there.  The photos being circulated with the false claim are indeed from Shaheen Bagh, but it cannot be insinuated that the protestors had deserted the site due to the Aam Admi Party's mandate.   It is also noteworthy to mention here that yesterday, Shaheen Bagh held a silent protest 'against Police brutality and State oppression'.

Photos tweeted by the news agency ANI, clearly shows their political neutrality.  Delhi: Protesters at Shaheen Bagh observe 'silent protest' today.  They hold placards reading 'we don't support any party'.  pic. twitter. com/TBCUtEuKw7 The timestamps of these tweets clearly show that the protests happened as it has been since December 15th 2019 for almost 55 days and has become a symbol of resistance against NRC, CAA and police brutality.  On normal days, the protest at Shaheen Bagh starts around 12 pm as confirmed by one of The Logical Indian reporters, who visited the site of the protest.  However, the picture taken by Amar Ujala was from an early morning scene when the protestors had not assembled.  Amit Malviya and several others had earlier tried to discredit the Shaheen Bagh movement using similar fake news.  The Supreme Court is slated to hear the matter of the protesters blocking the public roads and causing inconvenience to people on 17 February.  The protesters, however, aren't defiant and say that the apex court's order will be acceptable to them.  Women protesting at Shaheen Bagh had earlier sent a defamation notice to Amit Malviya on January 21 for his allegation that the women were paid to protest.  The office of advocate Mehmood Pracha had sent the legal notice charging Rs 1 crore for damages and also demanded an apology from Malviya.  The protesters' resolve, however, remains firm.  Therefore it can be confirmed that the protest has not been called off following AAP's victory in the Delhi assembly elections.  ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Update (APRIL 30, 2021): ICMR in its guidelines released on 22 April 2021, for management of adult COVID-19 patients has recommended the usage of Ivermectin (200 mcg/kg once a day for 3 days) for patients with mild /asymptomatic disease in home isolation.  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has also mentioned the usage of Tab Ivermectin in its revised guidelines for Home Isolation of mild /asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.  Ivermectin also finds a mention in FAQs on COVID-19 from AIIMS e-ICUs. A post claiming that ICMR in its guidelines specified the dosage and use of Ivermectin for both prevention as well as treatment of COVID\u00a0is doing rounds on social media.  Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: ICMR in its guidelines specified the dosage and use of Ivermectin for both prevention as well as treatment of COVID-19. Fact: ICMR did not recommend to use Ivermectin in treatment of COVID-19.  However, the UP government circular dated 06 August 2020 specified the dosage and use of Ivermectin for both prevention as well as treatment of COVID-19 in UP.  The speifications regarding the dosage and usage of the drug in both the UP government circular and in the post are similar.  The UP government\u2019s circular is being attributed to ICMR.  Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. When we searched on the ICMR website for any such advisory, we did not find any advising the usage of Ivermectin in COVID-19 treatment.  However, we found a Uttar Pradesh government circular dated 06 August 2020 which specified the dosage and use of Ivermectin for both prevention as well as treatment of COVID-19 in the state of UP.  However, nowhere in this circular, it is mentioned that ICMR prescribed this drug in the treatment of COVID-19.  Also, the specifications regarding the dosage and usage of the drug in both the UP government circular and in the post are similar.  With this, we can say that ICMR did not prescribe the usage of Ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19 and UP government\u2019s circular is falsely being attributed to ICMR. We could not find any news reports regarding the ICMR prescription of Ivermectin in treatment of COVID-19.  Also, in the news articles which reported the UP government\u2019s decision to use Ivermectin in treatment of COVID-19, it is nowhere mentioned that ICMR prescribed this drug in the treatment of COVID-19.  These news articles can be read here and here.  However, ICMR is investigating Ivermectin & Doxycycline as a potential treatment for Covid-19. Uttar Pradesh government recommends tablet 'Ivermectin' for prophylaxis in contacts and in health care workers and for treatment of asymptomatic to mild symptomatic #COVID19 patients.  pic. twitter. com/XEp75AIRrcTo sum it up, ICMR did not prescribe the use of Ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19.  However, the UP government advised its health officials to use Ivermectin in treatment of COVID-19. ",

    "claim": "#Analysis | Putting the consumer at the centre of Digital India\n\n(By Lloyd Mathias)\n\nhttps://t.co/9v8cWbK33x https://t.co/5ntumHICz1",
    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "The telecom revolution in India is an unparalleled success story. From a tele-density of 2% in 1995 to 12% in 2005 to over 90% in 2020, things have come a long way. India today has over 500 million active internet users, who consume the highest volume of data in the world (average of 25GB per month) and pay the lowest rates in the world (average price of $0.30 per GB vs $8 in the US). This massive rise in the use of the mobile internet helped lay the foundation for many businesses, besides delivering governance efficiently.With accelerating consumption, India has become a lucrative market for B2C tech companies, which thrive on a growing reliance on their platforms. But this also means that India urgently needs an evolved regulatory framework which empowers the consumer to utilise this digital transformation without being vulnerable to data security threats.So far, India\u2019s approach to consumer empowerment is inconsistent at best and depends on whether the sector has a regulator overseeing it. For sectors that have regulators \u2014 TRAI for telecom; SEBI for stock markets; RBI for banking \u2014 the government has managed to ensure greater transparency in protecting the interests of the consumer. Those that do not have regulators generally fall within the ambit of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) where the scope of the issue gets constrained to monetary transactions. As a result, there is no mechanism to redress issues such as losing privacy, as opposed to losing money.India\u2019s consumer internet is dominated by American Big Tech. This has implications for freedom of expression because its content rules and broader policy determinations will determine our online public squares. Repeated offences on data breaches and sharing of data between platforms have been ignored \u2014 in the absence of a regulator.India has conventionally resorted to broad trade and market restrictions \u2014 such as blocking \u2014 rather than nuanced regulation of the digital space. In a digitally integrated world, globalisation of ideas and information has helped economies find novel ways to power growth and inclusion. Denying digital access to certain services be it through app bans or internet shutdowns, is an act of digital de-globalisation.The Supreme Court, in 2019, acknowledged that internet access is integral to the right to freedom of speech and expression while adding that any restriction on internet access must pass the test of proportionality, and suggested the evolution of a rules-based mechanism to govern the internet. In 2020 alone, India lost $2.8 billion due to internet shutdowns, about three-quarters of the $4 billion lost worldwide due to internet curbs. Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which gives the government the provision to block public access to specific webpages, websites and mobile applications, has been used extensively, and often without accountability. As the government evolves its policies to empower a digital India, a comprehensive national security law needs to be brought in, which thrives on compliance rather than bans as a regulation mechanism. The Personal Data Protection Bill has a good approach on the consumer side whereby the emphasis is on providing more control and transparency to consumers, enabling them to become \u201cowners\u201d of their information. There, however, remains concerns, including the extent of autonomy of the Proposed Data Protection Authority which is supposed to be the regulator under the Bill.One way to empower consumers is by creating mechanisms to ensure inter-operability, by making it easier to switch services from one platform to another. In telecom, interoperability is implemented. However, in the internet space, and more prominently in the app space, consumers do not have this choice. People wanting to exit Facebook or WhatsApp cannot do so without relinquishing data, history, contacts. The journey towards a Digital India is rewarding and a great propeller for growth. A strong and consistent governance framework together with a digitally empowered Indian consumer will be a great step in building an Atmanirbhar Bharat.Lloyd Mathias is an early-stage investor and a business strategistThe views expressed are personal Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

The movie was \"The Toll of the Sea\". It was the first color feature made in Hollywood. The movie starred Anna May Wong. Wong never thought the movie would ever make it to the screen, but it did. In 1923, Paramount Pictures made the Cecil B. De Mille partial Technicolor epic \"The Ten Commandments\", which would be remade 33 years later by DeMille in 1956, also in color by Technicolor. Also in 1923, Prizma was used to film the 1923 version of \"Vanity Fair\". The third feature to be filmed entirely in color by Technicolor was \"Wanderer of the Wasteland\", today a lost film, released in 1924. It was advertised as being filmed in 100% Natural Color. Technicolor made many more silent films in color through the years, but in 1929, the first talking picture to use a color (Technicolor) sequence was \"The Broadway Melody\". The color hues of that sequence are lost; the sequence only survives in black-and-white television prints from the 1950s. That year, Warner Bros. made the first all color-all talking movie, \"On with the Show\", which also only survives in black and white, with only a small fragment of surviving color, found in 2005. Later in 1929, the first color talking movies were being made, such as \"Paris\" (Warner Bros.), \"Rio Rita\" (RKO, first RKO color movie, color sequenced), \"Sally\" (Warner Bros., third all-color, all-talking feature), \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" (Warner Bros., second all-color, all-talking feature), \"The Hollywood Revue\" (MGM's second musical, after \"The Broadway Melody\") and many more. Most of the color talking movies made in 1929 mostly survive in 1950s black-and-white television copies or with color sequences cut. In 1929, Technicolor was so busy filming color movies that the Warner Bros. musical revue \"The Show of Shows\" (1929), which was originally going to be filmed in full color, had to be filmed only mostly in color, with 21 minutes in black and white, a seventeen-minute section of part one and a four-minute opening of part two. While most companies used Technicolor, William Fox, owner of Fox Movie Corporation, used Multicolor.",

    "claim": "\"We have to assume what's happening in Portland could happen here.\"\n\nSeattle's Democratic Mayor Jenny Durkan says she does not want federal agents in her city as they are creating a \"public safety risk\" and a \"dangerous escalation\" in Portland. https://t.co/r5Ti7VlM2M",
    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "\"We need you to leave right now,\" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said. Federal clashes with Portland protesters raises legal questions about use of forceGarrison Davis, a 17-year-old videographer and citizen journalist in Portland, Oregon, has documented the city's Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality nearly every night since they began more than 50 days ago following the death of George Floyd. Over the weekend, he posted images on Twitter of a group of moms who had created what they called a \"Wall of Moms\" to protect protesters.  On the other side of their barrier, however, were not the city's own police force, but rather federal authorities.  A few hours after they'd formed the wall, the moms were among protesters who were tear gassed by these agents during violent clashes. Some of the federal agents in Portland are part of a Department of Homeland Security task force established to respond to the growing protests and acts of civil disobedience that have occurred across the country.  The U. S.  Marshals Service, which operates under the Department of Justice and partners with the DHS\u2019 Federal Protective Service to protect federal properties, had also been sent to the city.  The DHS said these forces were there to protect the federal properties from \u201ccriminal acts of violence and vandalism. \u201dBut as violence between the federal authorities and protesters increases, questions about their use of force and whether federal agents should be there in the first place have emerged. \"What's going on here isn't the federal government coming in to address real needs,\" said Vera Eidelman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.  \"There are real needs elsewhere.  It's the government miscasting protesters as violent criminals and trying to scare people from going out and protesting police brutality. \"Davis told ABC News the federal agents began arriving around the Fourth of July and that within days he \"saw Portland police pull back and the federal officers really take over trying to quell the protests. \"Those on the ground, however, say the federal agents have only inflamed tensions. \"The federal response, I think, caught a lot of people off guard,\" said Davis.  \"A lot of people here were not ready for that.  Protesters weren't ready for that.  Journalists were not expecting this to happen.  So I think that definitely caught a lot of people off guard. \"Daryl Turner, president of the Portland Police Association, told ABC News that \"every night we have violence -- we have rocks, bottles, bioweapons thrown at us.  . . .  And we are showing great restraint. \" He also called for the federal authorities to work \"in concert with local police. \"\"Right now, that's not happening and that concerns me,\" he said. On July 11, Davis recorded video of a protester getting shot in the head by an impact round fired by a federal agent.  The incident is now the subject of an investigation by the U. S.  Marshals Service, which will be reviewed by the U. S.  Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General, according to The Associated Press. \"I heard the impact.  I heard him fall.  I was standing like 10 feet away,\" said Davis.  \"I immediately turned to the side and I saw his body just on the ground, just blood pouring from his head.  People were grabbing him, pulling him into the park to get medical treatment.  . . .  His body was limp.  His head bobbing around.  He was taken to the hospital.  His skull was fractured.  . . .  It's that kind of unnecessary display of violence that didn't accomplish anything and wasn't a response to anything. \"Democratic Sen.  Jeff Merkley of Oregon also raised alarms last week when he tweeted a video that had circulated online showing agents pulling up to arrest a protester in what appeared to be an unmarked van. Mark Pettibone, another protester, says he too was taken by federal agents in an unmarked van and that he still doesn't know why he was detained. \"We were stopped by a smaller group of protesters . . .  and they warned us that there had been some vans that they saw driving around, basically snatching up protesters that were by themselves, away from larger crowds -- kind of vulnerable,\" Pettibone, 29, said.  \"And within seconds of them warning us about that, sure enough, one pulled up right in front of us.  So I fled. \"Pettibone said he ran because he had \"no idea who these people were. \" They were dressed in unmarked military gear and they did not state why they were stopping the protesters, he said. \"So I feared for my life and I ran.  They eventually caught up with me and pulled me into the van,\" Pettibone said, adding that the men who grabbed him pulled his hat down over his eyes as they searched for weapons. Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday that federal agents had been deployed to Portland after 35 to 40 straight days of violence during which \"we obtained intelligence that the federal facilities there were going to be targeted and were going to see directed violence. \"He said that officers were sent to help the base officers already present at these facilities and claimed the intelligence was correct.  \"Over the Fourth of July weekend, when we had advanced other officers to Portland, there were additional assaults on the individuals and the facilities themselves. \"Cuccinelli said that \"as long as the violence continues at that level associated with federal facilities, we'll have to maintain our elevated presence. \" He also said all federal agents are in uniform. \"The same protesters are coming night after night.  They all recognize them as uniformed and all of our agents that you've seen interact with any of these crowds have their insignia on their sleeves -- they're identified as police front and back -- so Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection or Federal Protective Service.  They are all clearly marked.  They all identify themselves to individuals with whom they are interacting.  For instance, if they are seizing somebody because they match the description of someone who assaulted a law enforcement officer, they identify themselves as federal agents immediately upon addressing that person.  So that's going on on a regular basis -- that's standard procedure. \"The incidents involving protesters being pulled into unmarked vehicles caught the attention of 53-year-old Christopher David, a U. S.  Navy veteran, who said he was shocked by the agents' actions. \"I saw the video of the men in combat fatigues with no insignia abducting citizens off the streets of Portland and stuffing them into unmarked vans,\" David said.  \"And I was very concerned about that because if the federal government can do that, anybody can go to the store and . . .  acquire used combat fatigues . . .  get an unmarked minivan and then go off and abduct people off the streets.  And we don't know whether that's the federal government or just a bunch of civilians playing dress up. \"David dressed in his old Naval Academy sweatshirt Saturday night when he attended the protests.  He said he had hoped to start a dialogue with the federal agents, and remind them of their responsibility to defend American citizens and the Constitution. \"I took the oath of office -- the oath of the Constitution -- extremely seriously, and I know that all federal employees do as well, including those men who are down there attacking people and gassing people in downtown Portland,\" David said.  \"And I wanted to ask them why they were no longer honoring their oath of office, why they were no longer honoring the Constitution, because what they were doing was blatantly unconstitutional. \"David wouldn't see federal agents for most of the night, during which he said the protests were mostly peaceful.  However, just as he was thinking about going home, he said eight to 10 of them came \"rushing\" out of the courthouse to confront a group of protesters. \"I had been standing in the park across from the courthouse when that happened,\" he said.  \"So I walked into the street right in front of the courthouse.  . . .  And after they got done with that group, chasing them off, they came to me and surrounded me, and I started trying to talk to them.  I said, 'Why are you dishonoring your oath to the Constitution?  Why are you doing unconstitutional things? '\"David said that as the officers approached him, one of them \"about 3 feet away\" pointed a semiautomatic weapon at his chest. \"Then another officer came and plowed into me . . .  he knocked me off balance,\" David said.  \"Then I plant myself right there.  I'm going to stand my ground right there. \"David said he knew the federal agents were going to beat him.  \"So I put my hands down and I just took it,\" he said.  He suffered a broken hand in two places and was treated by medics on site before being taken to the hospital, he said. \"I wasn't a real person.  I was a target with that guy,\" he said.  \"When that little dude started whacking me with his baton, I really wonder what he was thinking at that moment. \"David said he still doesn't know who they are or what agency they're from, and that he only saw alphanumeric codes on a little patch on their clothing. Richard Cline, deputy director of the DHS' Federal Protective Service, said during a press conference Tuesday that the incident involving David was being investigated. The U. S.  Marshals, whose officers were involved in the incident, told ABC News in part that their actions were based upon the circumstances at the time of the incident and that the deputies believed that the force used was necessary to protect themselves and others from physical harm. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was among six mayors from across the U. S.  on Monday who signed a letter demanding the federal government remove its agents from their cities, calling their deployment to the protests \"unacceptable\" and \"chilling\" and accusing Trump of \"terror tactics. \"Wheeler told ABC News he wants federal authorities removed before the violence goes too far. \"Your presence here isn't wanted,\" he told ABC News of the federal agents.  \"It is clearly ratcheting up the violence and the vandalism.  Local and state law enforcement can handle this, and we need you to leave right now before somebody dies. \"After months of unrest, the clashes in Portland seem far from over.  But there is still hope about where the movement will lead next. \"I want to use my 15 minutes to put out a message to my fellow vets,\" David said.  \"I also want to use my 15 minutes to try to refocus this whole discussion back to Black Lives Matter. \"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Navigation Acts, or more broadly The Acts of Trade and Navigation were a long series of English laws that developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce between other countries and with its own colonies. The laws also regulated England's fisheries and restricted foreigners' participation in its colonial trade. While based on earlier precedents, they were first enacted in 1651 under the Commonwealth. The system was reenacted and broadened with the restoration by the Act of 1660, and further developed and tightened by the Navigation Acts of 1663, 1673, and 1696. Upon this basis during the 18th century, the acts were modified by subsequent amendments, changes, and the addition of enforcement mechanisms and staff. Additionally, a major change in the very purpose of the acts in the 1760s \u2014 that of generating a colonial revenue, rather than only regulating the Empire's trade \u2014 would help lead to revolutionary events, and major changes in implementation of the acts themselves. The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships, required the employment of English and colonial mariners for three quarters of the crews, including East India Company ships. The acts prohibited the colonies from exporting specific, , products to countries and colonies other than those British, and mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain. Overall, the Acts formed the basis for English (and later) British overseas trade for nearly 200 years, but with the development and gradual acceptance of free trade, the acts were eventually repealed in 1849. The laws reflected the European economic theory of mercantilism which sought to keep all the benefits of trade inside their respective Empires, and to minimize the loss of gold and silver, or profits, to foreigners through purchases and trade. The system would develop with the colonies supplying raw materials for British industry, and in exchange for this guaranteed market, the colonies would purchase manufactured goods from or through Britain.Geoff Crammond is a computer game designer and programmer who specialises in motor racing games. A former defence industry systems engineer, he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Formula 3) back in 1984, but he holds a physics degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.",

    "evidence": "Eleven people, including four women and five children, were killed and four others injured when an SUV skidded off a road and fell into a deep gorge in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, police said.  The SUV, carrying 15 passengers from Chaderkote to Rajgarh, rolled down into the over 500-feet-deep gorge when its driver lost control at Kunda nallah near Baglihar power house at 10. 30 am, an official said.  He said the locals along with the police immediately launched a rescue operation and pulled out bodies and injured from the scene.  While six persons were found dead on-the-spot, five others succumbed on way to hospital, the official said, adding that three more critically injured persons, including driver of the vehicle, are being airlifted to Jammu for specialised treatment.  Rajgarh is a far flung tehsil in Ramban district and is connected with the Jammu-Srinagar national highway through a link road which is reportedly damaged at various places.  The allowed capacity for SUV operating in the hilly roads is only seven passengers and the driver of the vehicle has violated the directive, the official said.  He identified some of the deceased as Romal Din (61), Mohammad Mubeen (23), Rubeena Begum (30), Urmilla Devi (32), Babli Devi (37), 13-year-old Imano Bano, nine-year-old Arjun, two-year-old Pari, and a three-month-old baby.  Another child who was being airlifted to Government Medical College hospital Jammu succumbed at the helipad, the official said, adding the identity of the child and a woman is being ascertained.  In separate cases, a cyclist was crushed to death by an unidentified vehicle in Poonch district, while nine passengers were injured in a collision between two buses along the Jammu-Pathankot highway in Samba district on Saturday.  The cyclist, Prakash (48), a daily wager in Municipal Committee Poonch, was hit by an unidentified vehicle near Jhalas when he was on way to work Saturday morning, resulting in his on-the-spot death, officials said.

    "evidence": "Following the unrest between two communities in Telinipara area of Hooghly in West Bengal, a set of images showing injured people are being circulated to show how homes of Dalit Hindus are being burnt in the area.  However, the images are from Pakistan wherein few Hindus were attacked.  Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Police had mentioned that a case has been registered and the accused have been arrested.  CLAIM The claim along with the images reads: \u201c\u092a\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u092e \u092c\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u0917\u0932\u0940 \u091c\u093f\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u0947\u0932\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0926\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0918\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u0932\u093e\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\u201d (Translated: Homes of Dalit Hindus are being burnt in Telinipara in West Bengal\u2019s Hooghly district. ) Several social media users have shared the images with the same claim on Facebook and Twitter.  WHAT WE FOUND OUT On conducting a Google reverse image search, we found an article published by Jammu Kashmir Now on 11 May, suggesting that the images are from Pakistan where 21 Hindu houses were burnt down.  Further, we found tweets shared by lawyer and activist Rahat Austin on 10 May in which the same viral images can be seen.  He mentioned that the incident took place in Rahim Yar Khan in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province wherein Hindus were attacked, allegedly sexually assaulted and were forced to leave the area.  In another tweet, he mentioned that around 21 Hindus houses were burnt in a village in Pakistan\u2019s Sindh.  Responding to Rahat Austin, the official account of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Police mentioned that a case has been registered and the accused have been arrested.  When translated in English using Google translate, the tweet reads,\u201cCase No.  42/20 Crime 354/506/148/149 of this incident has been registered and the accused have been arrested. \u201d Further, even SP Atif Nazir tweeted by attaching the FIR copy and stated that it was a land dispute between the parties.  While there have been reports about clashes in Telinipara area of Hooghly in West Bengal, these images are from Pakistan.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland , the United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain , the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands . Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland.Although Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state , two of its Overseas Territories also share land borders with other sovereign countries . Gibraltar shares a border with Spain , while the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia share borders with the Republic of Cyprus , the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the UN buffer zone separating the two Cypriot polities . Apart from this land border , the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to its east , the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west , giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world .

Five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 , leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921 to resolve the Irish War of Independence . When it took effect one year later , it established the Irish Free State as a separate dominion within the Commonwealth . The UK 's current name was adopted to reflect the change . There are fourteen British Overseas Territories . These are the remnants of the British Empire which , at its height in the 1920s , encompassed almost a quarter of the world 's land mass and was the largest empire in history . British influence can be observed in the language , culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies .   The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world 's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity . The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index , ranking 16th in the world . It was the world 's first industrialised country and the world 's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries . The UK remains a great power with considerable economic , cultural , military , scientific and political influence internationally . It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and is seventh in military expenditure in the world . The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946 . It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor , the European Economic Community -LRB- EEC -RRB- , since 1973 . However , on 23 June 2016 , a national referendum on the UK 's membership of the EU resulted in a decision to leave , and its exit from the EU is currently being negotiated . The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , the Council of Europe , the G7 finance ministers , the G7 forum , the G20 , NATO , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- , and the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- .

    "evidence": "English -LSB- \u02c8\u026a\u014b\u0261l\u026a\u0283 -RSB- is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now the global lingua franca . Named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England , it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia -LRB- Angeln -RRB- peninsula in the Baltic Sea . It is closely related to the Frisian languages , but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , as well as by Latin and Romance languages , particularly French .   English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states . It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada , Australia , Ireland , and New Zealand , and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean , Africa , and South Asia . It is the third most common native language in the world , after Mandarin and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations , of the European Union , and of many other world and regional international organisations . It is the most widely spoken Germanic language , accounting for at least 70 % of speakers of this Indo-European branch .   English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years . The earliest forms of English , a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century , are called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England , and was a period in which the language was influenced by French . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible , and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire , modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries . Through all types of printed and electronic media , as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science , navigation , and law .   Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order , to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection , a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax . Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses , aspect and mood , as well as passive constructions , interrogatives and some negation . Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions -- in terms of phonetics and phonology , and sometimes also vocabulary , grammar and spelling -- English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease .

    "evidence": "A post with an image of a banner which has a slogan about Modi, Yogi and Lord Ram is being widely circulated on social media with the claim that this banner was displayed during the ongoing protests by farmers opposing the new farm bills.  Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Farmers displayed a banner against Lord Ram in the ongoing farmers\u2019 protest. Fact: This image of a banner with a slogan about Lord Ram was featured during the farmers\u2019 protest in Delhi back in 2018.  This has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers\u2019 protests.  Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. Reverse image search of the photo led us to a 2018 Facebook post which shared the same image.  According to this post, the image was shared associating it with farmers\u2019 protest back then. Taking a cue from the time period of the Facebook post, Google search with relevant keywords led us to a tweet by a news agency which shared an image of the same banner.  According to the tweet, the image is related to farmers protest near Jantar Mantar in Delhi in 2018.  Further, we found few news articles related to these protests by farmers around the same time period, these news articles can be read here and here. \u00a0Farmers reach Jantar Mantar to carry forward the second day of protests. Catch all the updates from the #FarmersMarch here: https://t. co/GWQGcVJKOy pic. twitter. com/irheK2nI5XIn the images shared by the news agency, we can spot AIKM (All India Kisan Sabha) placards along with the banner.  Further search on the AIKM Facebook page led us to images of the same banner which were posted back in 2018.  These can be seen here and here. We could not find any news articles associating this banner to the ongoing farmers\u2019 protest.  With all these pieces of evidence, we can conclude that the banner is associated with farmers protest back in 2018 and has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers\u2019 protest. In the light of the ongoing farmers protest opposing the new farm laws, posts like these are being widely shared on social media platforms with misleading claims. To sum it up, 2018 banner against Lord Ram during the farmers\u2019 protest in Delhi is falsely linked to ongoing farmers\u2019 protest. ",

    "claim": "When Attorney General William Barr released special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, he released 448 pages of written research and analysis.\n\nHe also attached 2,375 footnotes. https://t.co/iuZlbaqVSl https://t.co/U79CQ8WFjf",

    "evidence": "By Meg Wagner, Veronica Rocha, Brian Ries and Amanda Wills, CNNAttorney General William Barr said he gave special counsel Robert Mueller the opportunity to read his four-page memo to Congress -- which he said was not supposed to be a summary of the lengthy report -- but Mueller declined. Barr said he later received the letter from Mueller in which the special counsel expressed concerns\u00a0about Barr's memo. \"I asked him if he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate,\" Barr said. \u00a0\"But he was very clear with me\u00a0that he was not suggesting that\u00a0we had misrepresented his report. \"Attorney General William Barr recalled being \"surprised\" that special counsel Robert Mueller would not be making a decision on whether President Trump obstructed justice. \"We were, frankly,\u00a0surprised\u00a0by\u00a0that they were not going to\u00a0reach a decision on obstruction. \u00a0And we asked them a lot about\u00a0the reasoning behind this and\u00a0the basis for this,\" Barr said. Mueller's decision came up during a March 5 meeting, Barr said. Barr then explained Mueller's reasoning for the decision. \"He said that in the future, the\u00a0facts of the case against a\u00a0president might be such that a\u00a0special counsel would recommend\u00a0abandoning the OLC opinion but\u00a0this is not such a case,\" he said. Barr also said he was confused by why Mueller continued investigating obstruction if he felt he couldn't bring it to a conclusion. Here's how Mueller explains it:\"Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible.  The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.  And if individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at this time.  Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available. \"Attorney General William Barr said the publicly released version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report was only \"lightly redacted. \" Barr added that the \"vast\u00a0bulk of those redactions relate\u00a0to volume one,\" which is the part of the report that \"deals with collusion\u00a0and it relates to existing,\u00a0ongoing cases. \"\"Volume two has only about 2%\u00a0redactions for the public\u00a0version. \u00a0So 98% of volume two dealing\u00a0with obstruction is available to\u00a0the public,\" he said. \u00a0\"Given the limited amount of\u00a0redactions, I believe the\u00a0publicly released report will\u00a0allow every American to\u00a0understand the special counsel's\u00a0work,\" Barr said. Last month, Barr described the four kinds of information that redacted in the report:Democratic Sen.  Dianne Feinstein, a ranking member in the Senate Judiciary Committee, outlined details from special counsel Robert Mueller's report in her opening statement -- majorly contrasting Graham's. She drew comparisons between special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Attorney General William Barr's four-page memo didn\u2019t fully capture his report. \"Finally, while the March letter\u00a0to Congress and the April press\u00a0conference left the impression\u00a0there were no remaining\u00a0questions to examine, this\u00a0report notes several limitations\u00a0Mueller faced while gathering\u00a0the facts that Congress needed\u00a0to examine,\" she said. She also called on Mueller to testify before the committee. Feinstein's opening statement differed greatly from Sen.  Lindsey Graham, the committee's chairman. Graham's first 10 minutes of the Barr hearing rehashed some of the more prominent 2016 scandals and conspiracy theories, such as. . . From CNN's Kevin LiptakThe TVs in the White House are on and tuned to William Barr's testimony.  So far, some officials are downplaying the significance of Mueller's letter, saying the underlying conclusion of \"no collusion\" is not in question (though Mueller, of course, did not use that phrase).  The letter was related to Barr's assertions on obstruction and not on the questions of whether Trump associates conspired with Russia. One official suggested the President's initial \"total exoneration\" response to the report \u2014 which was informed by Barr's memo to lawmakers \u2014 would not likely have been dramatically different had Barr's letter been worded differently, since the \"no collusion\" conclusion was more cut-and-dry. \u00a0\u00a0Trump was always going to extract the most positive version of the findings to make his case, this official said, whether Barr helped him along or not. Officials still believe the most damaging part of Mueller's report for Trump was its broad depiction of the President as unethical and dishonest \u2014 and not any specific allegation that he worked to short-circuit the Mueller probe. Republican Sen.  Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he's read most of special counsel Robert Mueller's nearly 400-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Earlier in his remarks, Graham said the report showed \"no collusion, no coordination,\u00a0no conspiracy between the Trump\u00a0campaign and the Russian\u00a0government regarding the 2016\u00a0election. \"This is how he ended his opening remarks:\"I appreciate very much what Mr. \u00a0Mueller did for the country. \u00a0I have read most of the report. \u00a0For me, it is over. \"Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Russia interfered with the 2016 US election \u2014 and insisted that they are \"still doing it. \"Graham said the US needs to do more to \"defend democracy\" from Russia and other \"bad actors. \"\"It could be the Chinese or\u00a0somebody next. \u00a0My take away from this report is\u00a0that we've got a lot of work to\u00a0do to defend democracy against\u00a0the Russians and other bad\u00a0actors,\" he said. Republican Sen.  Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, just kicked off today's hearing with Attorney General William Barr. In his opening statement, Graham held up a copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, saying it showed that there was \"no collusion, no coordination,\u00a0no conspiracy between the trump\u00a0campaign and the Russian\u00a0government regarding the 2016\u00a0election. \"He then addressed Mueller's evidence on the obstruction of justice issue. \"As to obstruction of justice,\u00a0Mr.  Mueller left it to Mr.  Barr\u00a0to decide after two years and all this\u00a0time. \u00a0He said 'Mr.  Barr, you decide. '\u00a0Mr.  Barr did. \"Minutes before this hearing, Mueller's letter to Barr was made public.  In that letter, Mueller said Barr's summary of his report did not \"fully capture the context, nature and substance of the investigation,\" spurring \"public confusion. \"Graham has, so far, not mentioned Mueller's letter. In his letter to Attorney General William Barr, special counsel Robert Mueller said Barr's summary of his report did not \"fully capture the context, nature and substance of the investigation,\" spurring \"public confusion. \"Here's how Mueller put it:Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.

The film is the first installment in The Divergent Series and was produced by Lucy Fisher , Pouya Shabazian , and Douglas Wick , with a screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor . It stars Shailene Woodley , Theo James , Ashley Judd , Jai Courtney , Ray Stevenson , Zo\u00eb Kravitz , Miles Teller , Tony Goldwyn , Ansel Elgort , Maggie Q and Kate Winslet . The story takes place in a dystopian and post-apocalyptic Chicago where people are divided into distinct factions based on human virtues . Beatrice Prior is warned that she is Divergent and thus will never fit into any one of the factions . She soon learns that a sinister plot is brewing in the seemingly perfect society .   Development of Divergent began in March 2011 when Summit Entertainment picked up the film rights to the novel with Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher 's production company Red Wagon Entertainment . Principal photography began April 16 , 2013 , and concluded on July 16 , 2013 , with reshoots taking place from January 24 -- 26 , 2014 . Production mostly took place in Chicago .   Divergent was released on March 21 , 2014 , in the United States . The film received mixed reviews from critics , with praise going towards its concepts and action , and criticism focused on its execution . Reviewers found the film to be generic and unoriginal , comparing it unfavorably to other young adult fiction adaptations . Despite this , the film was a financial success as it reached the # 1 spot at the box office during its opening weekend . After its release , the film earned over US$ 288 million worldwide against its budget of US$ 85 million . It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 5 , 2014 .

    "evidence": "The Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston , Texas . The Rockets compete in the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- , as a member of the league 's Western Conference Southwest Division . The team plays its home games at the Toyota Center , located in downtown Houston . The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles . The team was established as the San Diego Rockets , an expansion team originally based in San Diego , in 1967 . In 1971 , the Rockets moved to Houston .   The Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967 . In the 1968 NBA draft , the Rockets , picking first overall , selected power forward Elvin Hayes , who would lead the team to its first playoff appearance in his rookie season . The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record until the 1976 -- 77 season , when they traded for center Moses Malone . Malone went on to win the NBA Most Valuable Player -LRB- MVP -RRB- award twice and led Houston to the conference finals in his first year with the team . He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981 where they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics , led by Larry Bird and future Rockets coach Kevin McHale .   In 1984 , the Rockets drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon , who would be paired with 7 ft Ralph Sampson , forming one of the tallest front courts in the NBA . Nicknamed the `` Twin Towers '' , they led the team to the 1986 NBA Finals -- the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history -- where Houston was again defeated by the Boston Celtics . The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s , but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second-round defeat to the Seattle SuperSonics in 1987 . Rudy Tomjanovich took over as head coach midway through the 1991 -- 92 season , ushering in the most successful period in franchise history . Olajuwon-led Rockets went to the 1994 NBA Finals and won franchise 's first championship against Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks . The following season , the Rockets reinforced by another All-Star , Clyde Drexler , repeated as champions as the sixth seed in the West and swept the Orlando Magic , led by a young Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway , in four games . Houston became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title .   The Rockets acquired all-star forward Charles Barkley in 1996 , but the presence of three of the NBA 's 50 greatest players of all-time -LRB- Olajuwon , Drexler , and Barkley -RRB- was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals . Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001 , and the Rockets of the early 21st century , led by superstars Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming , followed the trend of consistent regular-season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries . After Yao 's early retirement in 2011 , the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding , completely dismantling and retooling their roster . The acquisition of franchise player James Harden in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s . The Rockets , under general manager Daryl Morey , are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics -LRB- similar to sabermetrics in baseball -RRB- in player acquisitions and style of play .

Known as a magical order , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development . Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions , such as Wicca and Thelema , were inspired by the Golden Dawn , which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism .   The three founders , William Robert Woodman , William Wynn Westcott , and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers , were Freemasons and members of Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia -LRB- S.R.I.A. -RRB- . Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn .   The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the Masonic Lodges ; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men . The `` Golden Dawn '' was the first of three Orders , although all three are often collectively referred to as the `` Golden Dawn '' . The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four Classical Elements as well as the basics of astrology , tarot divination , and geomancy . The Second or `` Inner '' Order , the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis -LRB- the Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold -RRB- , taught magic , including scrying , astral travel , and alchemy . The Third Order was that of the `` Secret Chiefs '' , who were said to be highly skilled ; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order .

    "evidence": "A Houston high school had adopted a new dress code barring parents from showing up to school in leggings, hair rollers, pajamas or certain other items of clothing, despite criticism that the policy could be discriminatoryHOUSTON -- A Houston high school principal has implemented a dress code for parents because she says it is necessary to establish high standards for students, despite criticism that the move could be discriminatory. James Madison High School will turn away parents who show up to school wearing pajamas, hair rollers, leggings or certain other items of clothing, including bonnets. \"No one can enter the building or be on the school premises wearing a satin cap or bonnet on their head for any reason,\" Principal Carlotta Outley Brown said in a letter to parents dated April 9.  \"You also cannot wear a shower cap of any kind in the building. \"Madison High's dress code was established shortly after KPRC-TV in Houston reported that a parent attempting to enroll her child was asked to leave because of her attire, which included a headscarf and a T-shirt dress. Another Madison High parent, Tomiko Miller, told the         Houston Chronicle that she was \"almost insulted\" by the new code. \"I really think it was discriminatory, the language that was used,\" she said.  \"It was demeaning.  And I'm African American \u2014 and if it's misty outside and I have a hair bonnet on, I don't see how that's anyone's business. \"Zeph Capo, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, called codes relating to women's hair \"classist\" and \"belittling. \"\"I'm sorry, this principal may have plenty of money and time to go to the hairdresser weekly and have her stuff done,\" he told the newspaper.  \"Who are you to judge others who may not have the same opportunities that you do?  Having a wrap on your head is not offensive.  It should not be controversial. \"Houston Independent School District policy allows schools to establish standards for student attire and grooming, but no policy exists concerning parents, the Chronicle reported.  District administrators did not respond Tuesday to a request by The Associated Press for comment, and a message left for Outley Brown was not returned. \"Parents, we do value you as a partner in your child's education.  You are your child's first teacher,\" Outley Brown said in her letter.  \"However, please know we have to have standards, most of all we must have high standards. \"Also banned from school grounds are men wearing undershirts, parents wearing sagging pants or shorts, revealing tops, torn jeans \"showing lots of skin,\" and \"dresses that are up to your behind. \"Outley Brown, who is African American, took over as principal during the current school year, becoming the school's fourth principal in five years.  She previously was the principal at a Houston elementary school that routinely met state academic standards and occasionally earned awards for performing above average, the paper reported. The elementary school at one point received one of the country's highest academic honors and a U. S.  Department of Education publication noted at the time that Outley Brown, concerned that parents were showing up in \"inappropriately informal dress,\" would explain to them that \"they may not appear at school so dressed and firmly turned them away, as she did any parents using inappropriate language on school grounds. \"The push for parents to dress up has played out elsewhere.  A dress code previously was pitched by lawmakers in Tennessee, where a bill sponsored by state Rep.  Antonio Parkinson and one other ultimately was tabled.  The bill would require all Tennessee schools to adopt a parent code of conduct that could include a parental dress code. Parkinson brushed aside concerns that dress codes could target one class or race over another, telling the newspaper that, \"I'm not speaking about affordable as much as priorities.  . . .  What could be a higher priority than bringing your child to school?  You wouldn't go to a date like that. \"\u2014\u2014\u2014Information from: Houston Chronicle,         http://www. houstonchronicle. com24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "evidence": "Stone Spring is a 2010 novel by Stephen Baxter. It is set in prehistoric Doggerland (renamed \"Northland\" in the novel) and focuses on the attempts of Northland\\'s inhabitants to adapt to the rising sea levels slowly eroding Northland\\'s coastline. It is the first part of a trilogy detailing an alternate history in which human efforts were able to prevent Doggerland from being flooded.', \"The three Storegga Slides are considered to be amongst the largest known landslides. They occurred under water, at the edge of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea, approximately 6225\u20136170 BCE. The collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of 3500 km3 of debris, which caused a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean.\", \"Doggerland was an area now beneath the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to continental Europe during and after the last glacial period. It was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500\u20136,200 BCE. Geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland. It was probably a rich habitat with human habitation in the Mesolithic period, although rising sea levels gradually reduced it to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide.\"",

The price of petrol has jumped 35 times since May.  In Mumbai, a litre of petrol is priced at Rs 105 and in Delhi, it is Rs 95 a litre. A keyword search on Google took us to this video uploaded on YouTube in 2018, titled, \u201cAttack on Petrol Pump | Puri, Odisha | Bhubaneswar | Fuel price hike\u201d. Taking this as a clue we looked for news reports related to the incident.  We found a news report from 2018 by Odisha Bytes.  As per the report, the incident took place in Khuntia Petrol Pump, near Hospital Square in Puri, Odisha.  A customer accused that the petrol pump was cheating its customers by dispensing less fuel than what they paid for.  This led to an argument between the employees of the petrol pump and the customer.  Some locals joined in on behalf of the customer and later ransacked the petrol pump. \nSimilarly, OdishaTv. in reported that a customer had asked one of the petrol pump staff for a litre of petrol in a jar.  However, the petrol measured only 650 ml due to which an altercation ensued between the two.  Some locals also jumped in and allegedly ransacked the fuel dispensers and other property of the petrol pump.  A report by Omcom News says that the mob allegedly hurled a bomb at an oil tanker parked near the pump.  When the bomb failed to go off, the mob then tried to burn the tanker but their plan was foiled by police personnel who reached the spot.  \u201cIn the clash between people and police, over 15 journalists and media persons were injured who later went on to stage a road blockade in protest,\u201d added the report. In 2020, The Quint had done a fact-check on the incident where they spoke to inspector Kulamani Sethi of the Kumbharapada Police Station in Puri.  The police told The Quint that the video is from September 2018 and added that a case was registered against four people. Hence, an unrelated video of the ransacking of a petrol pump in Puri was shared as a recent event where the public vandalised a petrol pump due to the increasing price of petrol.

Brothers Keenen and Damon Wayans created , wrote and starred in the program . The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , California . The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented `` in living color '' during the 1960s , prior to mainstream color television . It also refers to the fact that most of the show 's cast were black , unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live whose casts are mostly white . It was controversial due to the Wayans ' decision to portray African-American humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as The Cosby Show , causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans .   Other members of the Wayans family -- Kim , Shawn , and Marlon -- had regular roles , while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra .

The show launched the careers of Carrey , Foxx , Davidson , Grier , Keym\u00e1h , Inaba , and Lopez and is credited with bringing the Wayans family to a higher level of fame as well . It was immensely popular in its first two seasons , capturing more than a 10-point Nielsen rating ; in the third and fourth seasons , ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights . The series won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety , Music or Comedy Series in 1990 . The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live , special episode as a counterprogram for the halftime show of U.S. leader CBS 's live telecast of Super Bowl XXVI , prompting the National Football League to book A-list acts for future game entertainment , starting with Michael Jackson the following year .

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Tyrus Raymond Cobb -LRB- December 18 , 1886 -- July 17 , 1961 -RRB- , nicknamed The Georgia Peach , was an American Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- outfielder . He was born in rural Narrows , Georgia . Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers , the last six as the team 's player-manager , and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics . In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot , receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes -LRB- 98.2 % -RRB- ; no other player received a higher percentage of votes until 1992 . In 1999 , editors at the Sporting News ranked Ty Cobb 3rd on their list of `` Baseball 's 100 Greatest Players '' .   Cobb is widely credited with setting 90 MLB records during his career . He still holds several records as of the end of the 2016 season , including the highest career batting average -LRB- .366 or .367 , depending on source -RRB- and most career batting titles with 11 -LRB- or 12 , depending on source -RRB- . He retained many other records for almost a half century or more , including most career hits until 1985 -LRB- 4,189 or 4,191 , depending on source -RRB- , most career runs -LRB- 2,245 or 2,246 depending on source -RRB- until 2001 , most career games played -LRB- 3,035 -RRB- and at bats -LRB- 11,429 or 11,434 depending on source -RRB- until 1974 , and the modern record for most career stolen bases -LRB- 892 -RRB- until 1977 . He still holds the career record for stealing home -LRB- 54 times -RRB- and for stealing second base , third base , and home in succession -LRB- 5 times -RRB- , and as the youngest player ever to compile 4,000 hits and score 2,000 runs . Cobb ranks fifth all-time in number of games played and committed 271 errors , the most by any American League -LRB- AL -RRB- outfielder .   Cobb 's legacy as an athlete has sometimes been overshadowed by his surly temperament and aggressive playing style , which was described by the Detroit Free Press as `` daring to the point of dementia . '' Cobb himself wrote shortly before his death , `` In legend I am a sadistic , slashing , swashbuckling despot who waged war in the guise of sport . '' Cobb was notorious for sliding into bases feet first , with his spikes high .   Cobb 's legacy , which includes a large college scholarship fund for Georgia residents financed by his early investments in Coca-Cola and General Motors , has been tarnished by allegations of racism and violence , largely stemming from a couple of biographies that were released following his death . Cobb 's reputation as an extremely violent man was fanned by his first biographer , sportswriter Al Stump , whose stories about Cobb have been discredited as sensationalized , and in some part proven to be entirely fictional , while Cobb 's views on race evolved and mellowed after his retirement from baseball .

Through this article let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: Video of BJP leader being thrashed by public in Bihar. Fact: The man in the video is actually attacked by Congress party workers and the incident took place in Indore, Madhya Pradesh and not Bihar as claimed.  Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. Google search with relevant keywords led us to a news article which reported the incident.  According to the article, the incident took place in Indore, Madhya Pradesh when a BJP worker wearing Modi mask was present at a rally organized by the Congress party on Gandhi Jayanthi over Hathras rape incident. Another news article dated 02 October 2020 which reported the incident can be read here.  Even this article reports that the BJP worker is thrashed by congressmen and the incident took place in Indore.  With all this, we can conclude that incident took place in Madhya Pradesh and not Bihar.  Further, the people who attacked the BJP worker were actually Congress party workers. In the wake of the upcoming Bihar elections, posts like these are being widely circulated on social media platforms with misleading claims. To sum it up, the BJP worker was actually attacked by Congress party workers in Madhya Pradesh and not Bihar. ",

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 150 million records worldwide . Born in Hoboken , New Jersey , to Italian immigrants , Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey . Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943 , becoming the idol of the `` bobby soxers '' . He released his debut album , The Voice of Frank Sinatra , in 1946 . Sinatra 's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s , and he turned to Las Vegas , where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack . His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity , with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor . Sinatra released several critically lauded albums , including In the Wee Small Hours -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , Songs for Swingin ' Lovers ! -LRB- 1956 -RRB- , Come Fly with Me -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , Only the Lonely -LRB- 1958 -RRB- and Nice 'n' Easy -LRB- 1960 -RRB- .   Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label , Reprise Records , and released a string of successful albums . In 1965 , he recorded the retrospective September of My Years , starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra : A Man and His Music , and released the tracks `` Strangers in the Night '' and `` My Way '' . After releasing Sinatra at the Sands , recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966 , the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim , the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim . It was followed by 1968 's collaboration with Duke Ellington . Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971 , but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace , and reached success in 1980 with `` New York , New York '' . Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base , he toured both within the United States and internationally until a short time before his death in 1998 .   Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor . After winning an Academy Award for From Here to Eternity , he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate -LRB- 1962 -RRB- . He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town -LRB- 1949 -RRB- , Guys and Dolls -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , High Society -LRB- 1956 -RRB- , and Pal Joey -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , winning another Golden Globe for the latter . Toward the end of his career , he became associated with playing detectives , including the title character in Tony Rome -LRB- 1967 -RRB- . Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971 . On television , The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950 , and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s . Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s , and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman , John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan , though before Kennedy 's death Sinatra 's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed .   While Sinatra never formally learned how to read music , he had an impressive understanding of it , and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music . A perfectionist , renowned for his dress sense and performing presence , he always insisted on recording live with his band . His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname `` Ol' Blue Eyes '' . Sinatra led a colorful personal life , and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women , such as with his second wife Ava Gardner . He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976 . Sinatra had several violent confrontations , usually with journalists he felt had crossed him , or work bosses with whom he had disagreements . He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 , was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 , and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997 . Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards , including the Grammy Trustees Award , Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . After his death , American music critic Robert Christgau called him `` the greatest singer of the 20th century '' , and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure . ",

Turkey is a democratic , secular , unitary , parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Turkey is bordered by eight countries : Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest ; Georgia to the northeast ; Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east ; Iraq and Syria to the south . The country is encircled by seas on three sides : the Aegean Sea is to the west , the Black Sea to the north , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . The Bosphorus , the Sea of Marmara , and the Dardanelles , which together form the Turkish Straits , divide Thrace and Anatolia ; they also separate Europe and Asia . Ankara is the capital while Istanbul is the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Approximately 70-80 % of the country 's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks . Other ethnic groups include legally recognised -LRB- Armenians , Greeks , Jews -RRB- and unrecognised -LRB- Kurds , Arabs , Circassians , Albanians , Bosniaks , Georgians , etc. -RRB- minorities . Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group , making up approximately 20 % of the population .   The area of Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations , as well as Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians and Armenians . After Alexander the Great 's conquest , the area was Hellenized , a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , starting the process of Turkification , which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks .   In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa , becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period . The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century , especially during the reign -LRB- 1520 -- 1566 -RRB- of Suleiman the Magnificent . It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries , until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe , signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth . After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers . During the war , the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian , Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens .   Following the war , the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states . The Turkish War of Independence -LRB- 1919 -- 1922 -RRB- , initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his colleagues against the occupying Allies , resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 , with Atat\u00fcrk as its first president . Atat\u00fcrk enacted numerous reforms , many of which incorporated various aspects of Western thought , philosophy , and customs into the new form of Turkish government .   Turkey is a charter member of the UN , an early member of NATO , and a founding member of the OECD , OSCE , OIC and G-20 . After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 , Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963 , joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005 . Turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history .   Turkey 's current administration headed by president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has reversed many of the country 's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey , such as Freedom of the Press , a Legislative System of Checks and Balances , and a set of standards for secularism in government , as first enacted by Atat\u00fcrk .

    "evidence": "Marilyn Monroe -LRB- born Norma Jeane Mortenson ; June 1 , 1926 -- August 5 , 1962 -RRB- was an American actress and model . Famous for playing comic `` dumb blonde '' characters , she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s , emblematic of the era 's attitudes towards sexuality . Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade , her films grossed $ 200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962 . She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon .   Born and raised in Los Angeles , Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen . While working in a factory in 1944 as part of the war effort , she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career . The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox -LRB- 1946 -- 1947 -RRB- and Columbia Pictures -LRB- 1948 -RRB- . After a series of minor film roles , she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951 . Over the next two years , she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies , including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business , and in the dramas Clash by Night and Do n't Bother to Knock . Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star , but rather than damaging her career , the story resulted in increased interest in her films .   By 1953 , Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars , with leading roles in three films : the noir Niagara , which focused on her sex appeal , and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire , which established her star image as a `` dumb blonde '' . Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career , she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio . She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project , but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career , The Seven Year Itch -LRB- 1955 -RRB- .   When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract , Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954 ; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions -LRB- MMP -RRB- . She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio . In late 1955 , Fox awarded her a new contract , which gave her more control and a larger salary . After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop -LRB- 1956 -RRB- and acting in the first independent production of MMP , The Prince and the Showgirl -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot -LRB- 1959 -RRB- . Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits -LRB- 1961 -RRB- .   Monroe 's troubled private life received much attention . She struggled with substance abuse , depression , and anxiety . She had two highly publicized marriages , to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller , both of which ended in divorce . On August 5 , 1962 , she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles . Although Monroe 's death was ruled a probable suicide , several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death . ",

It was his second No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States , after 1970 's `` Cracklin ' Rosie '' , and to date his last . The song spent twelve weeks in the Top 40 .

    "evidence": "Bermuda -LRB- -LSB- pronb\u0259r\u02c8mju\u02d0d\u0259 -RSB- -RRB- is a British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean . It is approximately 1070 km east-southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina ; 1236 km south of Cape Sable Island , Nova Scotia ; and 1578 km north of San Juan , Puerto Rico . The capital city is Hamilton . Bermuda is an associate member of Caribbean Community -LRB- CARICOM -RRB- .   The first person known to have reached Bermuda was the Spanish sea captain Juan de Berm\u00fadez in 1503 , after whom the islands are named . He claimed the islands for the Spanish Empire . Berm\u00fadez never landed on the islands , but made two visits to the archipelago , of which he created a recognisable map . Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription on Portuguese Rock -LRB- previously called Spanish Rock -RRB- . Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there , which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began . In 1609 , the English Virginia Company , which had established Jamestown in Virginia two years earlier , permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane , when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking , then landed ashore .   The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614 . Its spin-off , the Somers Isles Company , took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684 . At that time , the company 's charter was revoked , and the English Crown took over administration . The islands became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . After 1949 , when Newfoundland became part of Canada , Bermuda became the oldest remaining British overseas territory . After the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 , Bermuda became the most populous British territory . Its first capital , St. George 's , was established in 1612 .   Bermuda 's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance , and tourism , the two largest economic sectors . Bermuda had one of the world 's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond . Recently , its economic status has been affected by the global recession . It has a subtropical climate . Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle , a region of sea in which , according to legend , a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances . The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather . However , it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island . , The Caribbean Community -LRB- CARICOM -RRB- is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies whose main objective is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members , to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared , and to coordinate foreign policy . The organization was established in 1973 . Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning ; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction ; operating as a regional single market for many of its members -LRB- Caricom Single Market -RRB- ; and handling regional trade disputes . The secretariat headquarters is based in Georgetown , Guyana . CARICOM is an official United Nations Observer .   Established mainly by the English-speaking parts of the Caribbean , CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch-speaking Suriname on 4 July 1995 and French - -LRB- and Haitian Krey\u00f2l - -RRB- speaking Haiti on 2 July 2002 . Furthermore , it was suggested that Spanish should also become a working language . In July 2012 , CARICOM announced that they were considering making French and Dutch official languages.In 2001 , the heads of government signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into a Caribbean -LRB- CARICOM -RRB- Single Market and Economy . Part of the revised treaty establishes and implements the Caribbean Court of Justice . Since 2013 , the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Commission via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM signed in 2008 . The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment . Within the agreement under Article 234 , the European Court of Justice also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the European Union states . ",

    "evidence": "\n                Everything you need to know about bitcoin, blockchain, NFTs and more\n              \n    Apple has stunned investors with a stark warning about its business in China. \n  \n    US stock futures dropped sharply following Apple\u2019s announcement that it would miss its sales target for the final quarter of 2018 by at least $5 billion.  Apple blamed weak sales in China for the revised forecast, reinforcing concerns that the country\u2019s slowing economy is already hurting earnings for multinational companies. \n  \nDow futures pointed to a much lower open Thursday morning, falling 335 points.  S&P 500 futures were 1. 5% lower and Nasdaq futures plunged 2. 6%. \n  \n    Stocks in Asia declined for a second consecutive day, but the losses were small.  Benchmark indexes in Frankfurt and Paris dropped nearly 1% in early trade, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 opened down 0. 3%.  \n  \n    Apple (AAPL) announced Wednesday after the closing bell that it would report lower-than-expected sales from the last three months of 2018, primarily because of weak demand for iPhones in China.  In a letter to investors, CEO Tim Cook blamed the disappointing outlook on China\u2019s ongoing trade war with the United States and a number of other factors, including the company offering cheaper iPhone battery replacements. \n  \n    The company\u2019s warning rattled Wall Street investors who were already jittery about China.  Apple\u2019s announcement suggests corporate earnings estimates may be too lofty given challenges facing the global economy.  Apple provided some of the starkest evidence of the negative consequences of the US-China trade war. \n  \n    Apple shares listed in Frankfurt plummeted 8. 7% on Thursday.  The news also hit companies that provide components to the US tech giant.  Hon Hai Precision (HNHPD), better known as Foxconn, fell 1. 7% in Taipei.  Catcher Technology, which makes iPhone cases, dropped nearly 6%.  Shares in AMS (AMSSY), an Austrian company that makes light sensors, plummeted 20%. \n  \n    What happens in China matters for businesses and markets across the globe.  It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest exporter of goods, sucking in materials from other countries in order to ship out iPhones, laptops, bulldozers and tons of other products. \n  \n    The country\u2019s rapidly expanding middle class has turned it into the biggest market on the planet for consumer goods like cars, smartphones and beer, generating billions in profits for companies like General Motors and Apple. \n  \n    But after decades of expansion, the Chinese economy is slowing down.  Growth in 2018 is set to be the weakest since 1990.  And 2019 looks even worse.  The world\u2019s second largest economy, China is feeling the effects of a darkening trade outlook and government attempts to rein in risky lending after a rapid rise in debt levels. \n  \n    That has created a period of historic volatility in the stock market.  Investors, fearful that a Chinese economic slowdown could stunt growth in companies around the globe, have sent stocks rising and (mostly) tumbling sharply in recent weeks and months.  Between December 14 and 24, the Dow fell 350 points in six of seven sessions.  \n  \n    But stocks could bounce back.  Futures were down by about the same amount Wednesday morning, yet stocks plummeted in early trading before rallying back on optimism that supply constraints in the oil market may be under control.  The Dow bounced back from a 399-point drop, closing Wednesday 19 points higher. \n  \n  Daniel Shane and Charles Riley contributed to this report. \nAll Content by CompareCardsMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "evidence": "Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Friday described the beginning of the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the end of the pandemic as authorities across the country are all set to inoculate healthcare and frontline workers in the first phase from Saturday.  Vardhan also asked people to trust the indigenously manufactured vaccine as the government has \"given emergency use approval after scientific scrutiny. \"\"India is set to begin the world's biggest vaccination drive tomorrow.  This is the beginning of the end of Covid.  Both indigenously manufactured vaccines given emergency use approval after scientific scrutiny,\" he said, according to news agency ANI. Vardhan will participate in the vaccine rollout at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).  He will visit the new outpatient department (OPD) wing of the hospital to join the doctors and potential vaccine beneficiaries.  The drive will be virtually launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 10:30am. In a statement on Thursday, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said that more than 3,000 sites across all states and Union territories (UTs) will be virtually connected when Prime Minister Modi launches the drive. In the coming phases, people above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million will be inoculated.  The central government has introduced an application named Co-WIN, short for Covid Vaccine Intelligence Work, to monitor the entire vaccination process. Two vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield, have received the emergency use authorisation (EAU) after going through established safety and immunogenicity in a well-prescribed regulatory process and these will be administered during the vaccination drive. Meanwhile, the coronavirus infections continued to drop in India as the daily number of cases remained under 20,000.  At the peak of the outbreak, the number of daily infections had surpassed 95,000.  As of Friday morning, the country has 10. 52 million confirmed cases of Covid-19.  The death toll stood at 151,198. India is the second worst-hit country by the Covid-19 after the United States. ",

He governed the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 . In this capacity , he served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953 and as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 . Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist , he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism-Leninism while his own policies and theories became known as Stalinism .   Stalin was born to a poor Georgian family in Gori , Russian Empire . After an education at Tiflis Spiritual Seminary , he joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Affiliated with Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction , he raised funds via underground activities such as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery . After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and established a one-party state , Stalin sat on the Politburo during the Russian Civil War . In 1922 Stalin became General Secretary and established the Soviet Union . Despite Lenin 's objection , power consolidated around Stalin and opposition removed following Lenin 's death in 1924 . During Stalin 's tenure the concept of `` Socialism in One Country '' became a central tenet of Soviet society , and a cult of personality developed around Stalin . Lenin 's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy , industrialisation and collectivisation . These rapidly transformed the country from an agrarian society into an industrial power , but disrupted food production and contributed to the famine of 1933 -- 34 . Between 1934 and 1939 , Stalin organised the `` Great Purge '' , in which millions of so-called `` enemies of the working class '' , including senior political and military figures , were interned in Gulag-run prisons , exiled or executed , often without due process .   In August 1939 Stalin entered a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany , resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year . Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941 . Despite initial setbacks , the Soviet Red Army halted the German incursion and captured Berlin in May 1945 , ending World War II in Europe . The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and backed the establishment of pro-Soviet Marxist governments both throughout Eastern Europe and in China , North Korea , and North Vietnam . The Soviet Union and United States emerged as the two world superpowers , and a period of tensions began between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc known as the Cold War . Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase , during which it became the second country to develop a nuclear weapon , as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another major famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism . Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who denounced Stalin and initiated a de-Stalinisation process .   Stalin is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century . Stalinism influenced various Marxist-Leninist groups and governments across the world , for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class . After the fall of the Soviet Union , Stalin has been praised by supporters for his role in defeating Nazi Germany and establishing the Soviet Union as a major world power . Critics emphasise his role in causing millions of deaths and numerous political , religious and ethnic repressions . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the cell cycle. It alternates with the much longer \"interphase\", where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: G (first gap), S (synthesis), and G (second gap). During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the S phase. Thus, a cell grows (G), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are \"checkpoints\" that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter G phase to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded (density-dependent inhibition) or when they differentiate to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for human heart muscle cells and neurons. Some G cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.Mitotic indexing is the oldest method of assessing proliferation and is determined by counting the number of mitotic figures (cells undergoing mitosis) through a light microscope on H&E stained sections. It is usually expressed as the number of cells per microscopic field. Cells in the mitotic phase are identified by the typical appearance of their chromosomes in the cell during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Usually the number of mitotic figures is expressed as the total number in a defined number of high power fields, such as 10 mitoses in 10 high power fields. Since the field of vision area can vary considerably between different microscopes, the exact area of the high power fields should be defined in order to compare results from different studies. Accordingly, one of the main problems of counting mitosis has been the reproducibility. Thus, the need for standardized methodology and strict protocols is important to achieve reproducible results.",

With an estimated 704,352 residents , Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America . In July 2013 , it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1 % . In July 2016 , Seattle was again the fastest-growing major U.S. city , with a 3.1 % annual growth rate . The city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound -LRB- an inlet of the Pacific Ocean -RRB- and Lake Washington , about 100 mi south of the Canada -- United States border . A major gateway for trade with Asia , Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling .   The Seattle area was previously inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers . Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers , subsequently known as the Denny Party , arrived from Illinois via Portland , Oregon , on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13 , 1851 . The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named `` Seattle '' in 1852 , after Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes .   Logging was Seattle 's first major industry , but by the late-19th century , the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush . Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company , which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing . The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s , with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region . In 1994 , Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle . The stream of new software , biotechnology , and Internet companies led to an economic revival , which increased the city 's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000 .   Seattle has a noteworthy musical history . From 1918 to 1951 , nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street , from the current Chinatown / International District , to the Central District . The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles , Quincy Jones , Ernestine Anderson , and others . Seattle is also the birthplace of hip-hop sensation Neema , rock musician Jimi Hendrix , origin of the bands Nirvana , Pearl Jam , Soundgarden , Alice in Chains and the alternative rock subgenre grunge .

According to this act, state governments are entitled to prepare guidelines and to identify priority households. Accordingly, guidelines related to eligibility and exclusion issued by few states can be read here and here. The act also empowers the central government to make rules in consultation with states related to a few aspects of the act. Department of Food and Public Distribution which is the nodal agency for public distribution under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution prepares the rules on behalf of the central government under the NFSA. However, we could not find any notice on the department website saying ration card will be cancelled if not for three months. In the light of the central government\u2019s initiative of \u2018One Nation One Ration Card\u2019 system under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, posts like these are being circulated on social media platforms with misleading claims. To sum it up, central government has not issued any guidelines saying ration card would be cancelled if not used for three months. ",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "The government has allowed companies to spend their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds on research and development (R&D) for finding vaccines, medicines and medical equipments to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, two government officials said requesting anonymity. \u201cThe decision was taken in line with the Prime Minister\u2019s directive to encourage new drug discoveries for Covid-19, and a top official of the PMO [Prime Minister\u2019s Office] played an active role in this,\u201d one of the officials said. The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has already notified the two amendments in the CSR rules on Monday that would allow companies to spend their CSR funds in R&D activities related to new vaccine, drugs and medical devices in three financial years starting from 2020-21. The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year, to mandatorily spend 2% of average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR.  Money earmarked for spending on CSR activities in a year is about Rs 15,000 crore. MCA has amended the Schedule VII to include R&D for development of drugs to cure Covid-19 as one of the approved CSR activities, a second official said.  The government has specified broad areas of mandatory CSR spending in Schedule VII. Accordingly, contributions to R&D projects in the field of science, technology, engineering and medicine, funded by the central or state governments or any public sector entity would also be counted under CSR, he added.  Companies can now contribute their CSR funds to public funded universities, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Pharmaceuticals, he said.  They can also participate in institutions under the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH), he said.  Approved activities under Schedule VII of CSR include eradicating extreme hunger, poverty, promotion of education, promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment as well as reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health and combating diseases.  Ensuring environmental sustainability and prompting employment enhancing vocational skills are other activities approved under CSR. ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent -LRB- singles -RRB- or between two teams of two players each -LRB- doubles -RRB- . Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent 's court . The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return . The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point , while the opposite player will .   Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages . The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket , including wheelchair users . The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham , England , in the late 19th century as `` lawn tennis '' . It had close connections both to various field -LRB- `` lawn '' -RRB- games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis . During most of the 19th century , in fact , the term `` tennis '' referred to real tennis , not lawn tennis : for example , in Disraeli 's novel Sybil -LRB- 1845 -RRB- , Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will `` go down to Hampton Court and play tennis . ''   The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s . Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times , and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s . A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system , which allows a player to contest the line call of a point , a system known as Hawk-Eye .   Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport . The four Grand Slam tournaments -LRB- also referred to as the `` Majors '' -RRB- are especially popular : the Australian Open played on hard courts , the French Open played on red clay courts , Wimbledon played on grass courts , and the US Open played also on hard courts .

    "claim": "The nearly two-minute-long video shows a huge crowd of men standing together on a road, many of them carrying bags on their shoulders. Some policemen can be seen in the midst of the crowd wielding sticks and seemingly trying to get them in some order.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "A video of a huge crowd of people on a road and another group looking on from a terrace is going viral with the claim that it shows migrant labourers stuck at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border as they try to return home amid the coronavirus lockdown.  However, we found that it is actually a video from October 2019 that was taken at the time of a recruitment drive for the Territorial Army held in UP\u2019s Faizabad and is being falsely shared with this claim.  CLAIM The nearly two-minute-long video shows a huge crowd of men standing together on a road, many of them carrying bags on their shoulders.  Some policemen can be seen in the midst of the crowd wielding sticks and seemingly trying to get them in some order.  On Facebook, the video was shared with multiple similar claims.  One of them was shared with a message which said, \u201cSocial distancing at UP Border\u201d.  Uploaded by a user called Jatinder Cheema, the video had 10k views and over 900 shares at the time this story was published.  Many others shared the video with the claim that it showed migrants trying to return home stopped at Delhi-UP Border in Ghazipur.  \u201cEven animals are treated better,\u201d the claim continued.  On Twitter too, the video was viral with similar claims.  The above video had over 62k views and 1. 3k likes.  WHAT WE FOUND On watching the video, we noticed that nobody in the video, not even the policemen, was wearing a mask, which is unlikely to happen amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Even in videos that have surfaced of crowds thronging despite the pandemic, most people have been seen wearing masks.  Further, we noticed that the crowd comprised only men, which would again be unlikely in a scenario of migrant workers gathering at a border to return home.  This brought us to the conclusion that this was an old video.  We then broke up the video into keyframes using the software Invid and ran a reverse search on it, through the search engine Yandex.  This took us to a YouTube video from October 2019, which claimed that the scene showed a recruitment drive held by the Territorial Army in Faizabad on 15 October 2019.  The video was the same as the viral one, but taken from a slightly different angle.  The video had been uploaded on 15 October 2019 itself.  Taking a cue from this, we ran a search on YouTube with keywords like \u2018TA Faizabad October 2019\u2019 which took us to more videos of the same scene.  (Warning: Below video contains explicit language. ) The same blue signboard that can be seen in the viral video is also present in this video, as are the vehicles seen parked in the midst of the crowd.  We also found several other videos of the same scene.  Further, we came across news reports which corroborated the fact that a TA recruitment drive had been held in Faizabad\u2019s Dogra Regimental Centre between 14-19 October.  These reports said that there had been huge crowds as a result of the recruitment drive.  One report even said that the crowds created a situation which required the police to step in and use mild force, which could be an explanation for the policemen using lathis in the viral video.  Therefore, it is clear that an old, unrelated video is being used to spread the false claim that it shows migrants stuck at the UP-Delhi border.  However, it is true that there are in fact migrant workers stranded at the Delhi-UP border in Ghazipur as they await an opportunity to be allowed to return home.  According to a Hindustan Times report, some of these people are migrant who have reached Delhi by train from other states and are trying to return to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bihar.

    "evidence": "Filming began in April 2013; Jaa was announced as co-director the same month. After three months of filming, production came to an abrupt halt with only 20% of the film complete. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49\u201350 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures in September 2013, claiming that Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting the role of Kiet in \"Fast and Furious 7\". Sahamongkol based their sum on the cost of launching Jaa's career and loss of future earnings, plus an additional 7.5% interest. They attempted to halt the release of \"Fast and Furious 7\" in Thailand, and on March 27, 2015, a civil court approved, blocking release the film until a settlement had been reached by both parties. The court came to its decision after interviewing two employees of Sahamongkol: Akarapol Karasaranee, the son of the company's president, Somsak Techaratanaprasert; and Suwat Apaipak, a member of Sahamongkol's legal team. In response to the allegations, Jaa stated that his contract with Sahamongkol had ended. He claimed that it was terminated through his lawyer in 2013, describing it as \"business slavery\" due to its allegedly overrestrictive terms and conditions. Sahamongkol claimed that the contract had been renewed for another ten years, through 2023. In the suit, Sahamangkol also requested that Jaa pay back his salary for \"A Man Will Rise\", reportedly \u0e3f26 million ($722,000). The legal matters surrounding the lawsuit have prevented the completion of the film, and although the lawsuit was dropped in July 2015, the film remains unfinished. There are currently no plans to complete the film.Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 or Fast Seven) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the seventh installment in \"The Fast and the Furious\" franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. \"Furious 7\" follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in \"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again.",

Written by Jonze and Dave Eggers , it is adapted from Maurice Sendak 's 1963 children 's book of the same name . It combines live-action , performers in costumes , animatronics , and computer-generated imagery -LRB- CGI -RRB- . The film stars Max Records and features the voices of James Gandolfini , Paul Dano , Lauren Ambrose , Forest Whitaker , Catherine O'Hara , and Chris Cooper . The film centers on a lonely eight-year-old boy named Max who sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the `` Wild Things , '' who declare Max their king .   In the early 1980s , Disney considered adapting the film as a blend of traditionally animated characters and computer-generated environments , but development did not go past a test film to see how the animation hybridizing would result . In 2001 , Universal Studios acquired rights to the book 's adaptation and initially attempted to develop a computer-animated adaptation with Disney animator Eric Goldberg , but the CGI concept was replaced with a live-action one in 2003 , and Goldberg was dropped for Spike Jonze . The film was co-produced by actor Tom Hanks through his production company Playtone and made on an estimated budget of $ 100 million . Where the Wild Things Are was a joint production between Australia , Germany , and the United States , and was filmed principally in Melbourne .   The film was released on October 16 , 2009 , in the United States , on December 3 in Australia , and on December 17 in Germany .

He is widely considered the wealthiest American of all time , and the richest person in modern history .   Born into a large family in upstate New York , he was shaped by his con man father and religious mother . His family moved several times before eventually settling in Cleveland , Ohio . Rockefeller became an assistant bookkeeper at the age of 16 , and went into a business partnership with Maurice B. Clark and his brothers at 20 . After buying them out , he and his brother William founded Rockefeller & Andrews with Samuel Andrews . Instead of drilling for oil , he concentrated on refining . In 1867 , Henry Flagler entered the partnership . The Rockefeller , Andrews & Flagler company grew by incorporating local refineries . Rockefeller formally founded the Standard Oil Company , Inc. in 1870 as an Ohio partnership with his brother , Henry Flagler , Jabez A. Bostwick , Samuel Andrews , and a silent partner , Stephen V. Harkness . He ran it until 1897 . As kerosene and gasoline grew in importance , Rockefeller 's wealth soared and he became the richest person in the country , controlling 90 % of all oil in the United States at his peak . Oil was used throughout the country as a light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile . Furthermore , Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry , which transported his oil around the country . Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States . Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry , and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie , defined the structure of modern philanthropy .   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil must be dismantled for violation of federal anti-trust laws ; it was broken up into 34 separate entities that included companies that would become ExxonMobil , Chevron , and others ; some of them still having the largest revenue . Individual pieces of the company were worth more than the whole , and as shares of these doubled and tripled in value in their early years , Rockefeller became the country 's first billionaire with a fortune worth nearly 2 percent of the national economy . His peak net worth was estimated at $ 336 billion -LRB- in 2007 USD ; inflation-adjusted -RRB- in 1913 . Rockefeller spent the last 40 years of his life in retirement at his estate in Westchester County , New York . His fortune was mainly used to create the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy through the creation of foundations that had a major effect on medicine , education and scientific research . His foundations pioneered the development of medical research and were instrumental in the eradication of hookworm and yellow fever .   Rockefeller was also the founder of both the University of Chicago and Rockefeller University and funded the establishment of Central Philippine University in the Philippines . He was a devout Northern Baptist , and supported many church-based institutions . Rockefeller adhered to total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco throughout his life . He was a faithful congregant of the Erie Street Baptist Mission Church , where he taught Sunday school , and served as a trustee , clerk , and occasional janitor . Religion was a guiding force throughout his life , and Rockefeller believed it to be the source of his success . Rockefeller was also considered a supporter of capitalism based on a perspective of social Darwinism , and was quoted often as saying `` The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest '' .

It is the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea , Indonesia and East Timor to the north ; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east ; and New Zealand to the south-east . Australia 's capital is Canberra , and its largest urban area is Sydney .   For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century , Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians ,  who spoke languages classifiable into roughly 250 groups . After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades , and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories . The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard .   Australia has the world 's 13th-largest economy and ninth-highest per capita income -LRB- IMF -RRB- . With the second-highest human development index globally , the country ranks highly in quality of life , health , education , economic freedom , and civil liberties and political rights . Australia is a member of the United Nations , G20 , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- , World Trade Organization , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , and the Pacific Islands Forum . , The World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- is an intergovernmental organization that regulates international trade . The WTO officially commenced on 1 January 1995 under the Marrakesh Agreement , signed by 123 nations on 15 April 1994 , replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- , which commenced in 1948 . It is the largest international economic organisation in the world . The WTO deals with regulation of trade between participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants ' adherence to WTO agreements , which are signed by representatives of member governments and ratified by their parliaments . Most of the issues that the WTO focuses on derive from previous trade negotiations , especially from the Uruguay Round -LRB- 1986 -- 1994 -RRB- .   The WTO is attempting to complete negotiations on the Doha Development Round , which was launched in 2001 with an explicit focus on developing countries . , the future of the Doha Round remained uncertain : the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed , and the round is still incomplete . The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sector -LRB- requested by developed countries -RRB- and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products -LRB- requested by developing countries -RRB- remain the major obstacles . This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round . As a result , there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments . As of July 2012 , there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation which is in the condition of stalemate .   The WTO 's current Director-General is Roberto Azev\u00eado , who leads a staff of over 600 people in Geneva , Switzerland . A trade facilitation agreement , part of the Bali Package of decisions , was agreed by all members on 7 December 2013 , the first comprehensive agreement in the organization 's history . ",

It introduces the six main characters of the series which are Sonny Munroe (Demi Lovato), Tawni Hart (Tiffany Thornton), Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight), Nico Harris (Brandon Mychal Smith), Grady Mitchell (Doug Brochu), and Zora Lancaster (Allisyn Ashley Arm).BULLET::::- Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on \"Mackenzie Falls\", the rival teen TV series of \"So Random!\". He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the \"So Random!\" cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.",

    "evidence": "On 14 August 2018, Omarosa Manigault Newman, former Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison in the Trump administration, appeared on the Daily Show to talk about her new tell-all book, Unhinged.  Although the conversation primarily focused on the former Apprentice contestant\u2019s experiences in the Trump White House, Omarosa also dropped a curious statistic about the number of murders in Chicago. While criticizing President Trump for not living up to his campaign promise to reduce violence in Chicago, Omarosa declared that the Second City had seen \u201c600 murders over this weekend.\u201d That comment can be heard around the 6-minute mark of the following video:  That claim was absurd. Omarosa appeared to be referring to the number of murders that had occurred over the previous weekend,  but the number of people killed in Chicago over the second weekend in August wasn\u2019t even close to 600. According to NBC Chicago, the actual number of people murdered that weekend was one: The Chicago Tribune reported similar statistics: No Chicago weekend in 2018 was as deadly as Omarosa claimed. In fact, according to the Tribune, the city hadn\u2019t seen 600 murders throughout all of 2018 up to that point: As far as we can tell, no weekend in the recent history of Chicago has seen the amount of murders claimed by Omarosa. While the number of homicides in Chicago reached 900 during a few years in the 1970s and 1990s, the majority of years (let alone weekends) over the last several decades didn\u2019t see 600 murders:  This is the second time in recent weeks that number of murders in Chicago has been grossly exaggerated by a member (or former member) of President Trump\u2019s team. The president\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, claimed in a tweet that 63 murders were recorded over the first weekend in August 2018 in Chicago:  The weekend Giuliani was referring to, however, saw 63 people shot, not murdered. Only 12 people were killed during the first weekend of August. We\u2019ve reached out to Omarosa to find out exactly what she was referencing in her citing of crime statistics. It\u2019s possible that she misspoke and was attempting to refer to the number of murders in Chicago the previous year, not the previous weekend. If that\u2019s the case, it is true that Chicago saw more than 600 murders in 2017.

    "evidence": "CLAIM A video purportedly showing the process of milk adulteration in India recently went viral on social media.  The video cites World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics and is accompanied by the caption: \"As per WHO, India produces 14 crore litres of milk and sells around 50+ crore litres of milk.  They say Indians are drinking poision and not milk. . .  due to such huge adulteration, 87 percent of population in India could suffer from cancer.  [sic]\" The video, shared by one Rohit Borana on Facebook, garnered a whopping 1. 8 million views and has been shared over 87,000 times.  The video has also been independently shared by scores of others users on social media.  TRUE OR FALSE?  The video is NOT showing any adulteration of milk.  As pointed out by SM Hoaxslayer, the viral video is actually of white phenyl that looks like milk after water is added to it.  So, the video shows water being added to phenyl concentrate which gives it the white colour.  Nevertheless, adulteration of milk and milk products in the country remains an issue of serious concern.  In September, a member of the Animal Welfare Board of India said that around 68. 7 percent of milk and milk products sold in the country are not as per the standards laid down by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).  The member, Mohan Singh Ahluwalia, was quoted by PTI as saying: WHO had also recently issued an advisory to the Government of India stating that if adulteration of milk and milk products is not checked immediately, 87 percent of citizens would be suffering from serious diseases like cancer by the year 2025, reported PTI.

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "In the decade leading up to World War II, the French built the Maginot Line, based on their experience with trench warfare in World War I. The Maginot Line was an extensive state-of-the-art defensive system far superior to any previous trench system: a chain of massive constructions of concrete, iron, and steel fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, linked by tunnel networks. It covered the length of the Franco-German border and was wide. It was supported by numerous underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, with its own telephone network and narrow gauge railways with armoured locomotives, backed up with heavy rail artillery. French military experts placed high value on the Line, saying it would curb German aggression, as any invasion force would be halted long enough for French forces to mobilize and counterattack through Belgium. It was only partially successful; in the Battle of France, the main German \"\"Blitzkrieg\"\" attack struck through the weakly held Ardennes forest, the gap between the end of the Maginot Line and the advancing Anglo-French mobile forces heading into Belgium. Small secondary German attacks concentrated at a few points in the Line had moderate success. The bulk of the Maginot Line was untouched, and survives today.The Second and Ninth armies were dug in on the west bank of the Meuse on ground that was easily defended and behind the Ardennes, giving plenty of warning of a German attack. After the transfer of the Seventh Army, seven divisions remained behind the Second and Ninth armies and other divisions could be moved from behind the Maginot Line. All but one division were either side of the junction of the two armies, GQG being more concerned about a German attack past the north end of the Maginot Line and then south-east through the Stenay Gap, for which the divisions behind the Second Army were well placed. On 8 November, Gamelin added the Seventh Army, containing some of the best and most mobile French divisions, to the left flank of the 1st Army Group to move into Holland and protect the Scheldt estuary. In March, Gamelin ordered that the Seventh Army would advance to Breda to link with the Dutch. The Seventh Army, on the left flank of the Dyle manoeuvre, would be linked to it and if the Seventh Army crossed into the Netherlands, the left flank of the 1st Army Group was to advance to Tilburg if possible and certainly to Breda. The Seventh Army was to take post between the Belgian and Dutch armies turning east, a distance of , against German armies only distant from Breda.",

It showed us that the photo has been present on the internet since 2013 and that the incident took place in Mexico's Congress. We found news articles dating back to December 2013 by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and the BBC.  According to a report published by WSJ on December 12, 2013, the dramatic scenes had occurred when Mexico's Congress voted for an energy bill that would end a 75-year-old monopoly of the state-owned oil firm Pemex (Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos). For the first time since 1938, private firms would be allowed to explore and extract oil and gas with Pemex and have a share of the profits. While a few politician protested the bill, proponents argued that it would bring tens of billions of dollars of foreign investment to Mexico. The reports stated that a leftist lawmaker, man in the viral photograph, who was protesting the bill stripped to his underwear and said, \"this is the way you're stripping the country to the bone.\"    \"This is how you're stripping the nation. Where is the benefit? I'm not ashamed, what you're doing is a shame!\" BBC quoted him as saying. Also Read:No, Forbes Did Not Name Rahul Gandhi On A 'Most Educated Leaders' List       ",

But, let me make this absolutely clear: Kashmir is India\u2019s internal issue & there is no room for Pakistan or any other foreign country to interfere in it,\u201c Gandhi tweeted on Wednesday.There is violence in Jammu & Kashmir because it is instigated and supported by Pakistan which is known to be the \u2018prime supporter of terrorism across the world\u2019, the Congress leader added.The Congress, backing Gandhi\u2019s remarks, added: \u201cThe INC has noticed reports citing an alleged petition moved by Pakistani Government to United Nations on Jammu & Kashmir, wherein name of Shri Rahul Gandhi has been mischievously dragged to justify the pack of lies and deliberate misinformation being spread by Pakistan.\u201dThe statement added: \u201cLet no one in the world be in doubt that Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh were, are and shall always remain an integral part of India. No amount of diabolical deception by Pakistan shall change this irrevocable truth.\u201d The party asked Pakistan to instead answer the world about unpardonable and inhumane violations of human rights in PoK-Gilgit-Hunza-Baltistan. \u201cPakistan also owes an explanation for designed persecution of over 70 million Mohajirs and killing of over 25,000 by Pakistani Forces,\u201d the statement said.Stressing that Pakistan was the fountainhead of terrorism, the party said that every terrorist organisation thrives in Pakistan under political and military patronage -- be it Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Muhammad, Hizbul Mujahedeen, Al-Queda or Taliban and its multiple offshoots.Pakistan has been trying to muster international support on its Kashmir narrative, after the Modi government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status, but with limited support.

When narrowing occurs in the heart , it is called coronary artery disease , while , in the brain , it is called cerebrovascular disease . Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs , but other arteries may also be involved . The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest , known as intermittent claudication . Other symptoms including skin ulcers , bluish skin , cold skin , or poor nail and hair growth may occur in the affected leg . Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation ; coronary artery disease , or stroke . Up to 50 % of cases of PAD are without symptoms .   The main risk factor is cigarette smoking . Other risk factors include diabetes , high blood pressure , and high blood cholesterol . The underlying mechanism is usually atherosclerosis . Other causes include artery spasm . PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index -LRB- ABI -RRB- less than 0.90 , which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm . Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used . Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time ; however , it is associated with greater risks .   It is unclear if screening for disease is useful as it has not been properly studied . In those with intermittent claudication from PAD , stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy improves outcomes .

The Sena\u2019s allies \u2013 the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress \u2013said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was now using Central agencies to disrupt the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.  However, leader of the opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis dismissed any politically motivated action.  Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the move was politically motivated.  He dared the BJP to come out in the open to fight the Shiv Sena and \u201cnot hide behind Central agencies\u201d.  Also read: ED raids Shiv Sena lawmaker Pratap Sarnaik\u2019s premises\u201cIf anybody thinks this government will come under pressure with the use of central agencies, they are living in a fool\u2019s paradise.

No matter how many notices you send, how many raids you conduct or false papers and evidence you create, the truth will prevail,\u201d Raut said.  He added, \u201cThe BJP should come out in the open and fight us and not use Central powers and agencies like ED and CBI as tools.  The ED or any other agency should not work as a branch of a political party. \u201d NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who got served a notice by ED in October 2019, called the use of agencies against political opponents inappropriate.  He said the MVA government has the backing of the people and the BJP was using the ED to dislodge the government.  \u201cThe MVA government has completed one year in power.  The BJP has realised now that they cannot dislodge the government and hence they have been using the power they have as the ruling party at the national level.  Instead of answering the questions raised by people, Central agencies are being used against political opponents, which is not appropriate,\u201d he said.  Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat echoed his allies\u2019 thoughts.  \u201cNo such action has been taken against any leader in BJP-led states.  Leaders who have been taking a stand against the BJP are facing such actions.

However, I can say that nobody should be scared of any such action if nothing wrong has been done. \u201d Sarnaik later emerged at Sena mouthpiece Saamana office in Parel for the first time since the ED action began on Tuesday morning.  He held an hour-long meeting with Raut at the office.  Sarnaik refused to comment on the ED raid or the exact case in which his son Vihang was detained.  Sarnaik is also said to have held a meeting with his lawyers on the case.  \u201cLet me find out what has happened.  So far, we do not have any details,\u201d he said.

    "claim": "the bucs played oakland raiders in the super bowl.",
    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Bucs went on to rout Gruden\u2019s former team, the Oakland Raiders, by a score of 48\u201321 in Super Bowl XXXVII. Gruden\u2019s familiarity with the Raiders\u2019 players and playbook paid off, as John Lynch and other Bucs players recognized some of Oakland's formations and plays at crucial points in the game. The Bucs became the first team to win the Super Bowl without any picks in the first two rounds of the previous spring's NFL Draft, having traded these picks to the Oakland Raiders for the rights to acquire Gruden. Gruden became the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl.The poor 2009 record of Tampa Bay was in part due to a youthful, inexperienced team (barring a few exceptions such as 35-year-old CB Ronde Barber, the last remaining member of the 2002 Super Bowl team), and it was hoped that they would improve with time. The Buccaneers got off to a 2\u20130 start in 2010 by beating Cleveland and Carolina, but both proved weak opponents and they could never handle Pittsburgh, a team only two years removed from its 2008 Super Bowl win, losing 38\u201313. Following their bye week, they beat the Bengals in Cincinnati 24\u201321. After the road victory in Cincinnati, the Bucs came home to face the defending Super Bowl champion Saints, who were struggling after a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in which the Cardinals did not score an offensive touchdown, but capitalized on New Orleans turnovers. A victory would have helped the Bucs towards first place in the NFC South; however, they were blown out 31\u20136. The next week saw another home deficit against the St. Louis Rams with the Bucs trailing 6\u201317 at halftime. Strong defense shut down the Rams\u2019 offense in the second half, and with two field goals and a late touchdown pass to Carnell \u201cCadillac\u201d Williams, the Bucs topped the Rams 18\u201317. After the game with the team standing at 4\u20132, head coach Raheem Morris would famously state, \u201cWe\u2019re the best team in the NFC.\u201d The following week, the Bucs would make good on Morris's claim by defeating the Arizona Cardinals on the road in a game where they led 31\u201314, fell behind late 35\u201331, then retook the lead 38\u201335 and sealed the victory with an Aqib Talib interception of Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson near the end zone. With the Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons tied for first place in the division at 5\u20132, a matchup in Atlanta gave the Bucs a chance to take sole possession of first place. Trailing 27\u201314 in the second half, Bucs returner Micheal Spurlock returned a Falcons kickoff for a touchdown to put the Bucs within a touchdown of the lead. The game came down to fourth down attempt to score from the Falcons 1 yard-line. Rookie running back LeGarrette Blount was stopped up the middle and gave the Falcons the close victory. Following the tough loss, the Bucs came home and defeated the Carolina Panthers 31\u201316 before going on the road against the San Francisco 49ers and pitching a 21\u20130 shutout. The next week, the Bucs road game against the Baltimore Ravens, their fourth game away from Raymond James Stadium in five weeks, was moved to a late start, and the Bucs lost a hard-fought defensive struggle 17\u201310. Finally returning home the next week, the team sported their throwback creamsicle uniforms and honored coach John McKay at halftime in a home contest against the Falcons on national television. With a great defensive performance and two interceptions of Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, it seemed the Bucs would get revenge on the Falcons for their loss four weeks ago, leading 24\u201314 deep in the second half. But Falcons returner Eric Weems returned a kick for a touchdown and the Falcons scored offensively to take a 28\u201324 lead. Quarterback Josh Freeman attempted the late comeback as he had against the Browns, Bengals, Rams, and Cardinals, but was denied with a Brent Grimes interception. At 7\u20135, the Bucs\u2019 playoff hopes seemed less assured, and the team had yet to defeat an opponent with a winning record, while several key starters had been lost for the season. In a rainy outing at Washington, the Bucs prevailed 17\u201316 thanks to a botched extra-point attempt by the Redskins, but lost to the Detroit Lions at home in overtime to break the Lions' historic road losing streak. Needing help to make the playoffs as a wild-card team, the Bucs routed the eventual NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks 38\u201315 in Tampa. With the last week of the regular season on the slate, the Bucs needed to defeat the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome, then hope for the defeats of the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants by the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, respectively, as both teams held playoff tiebreakers over the Buccaneers. The Saints planned to fight the Bucs equally hard, as a victory and a Falcons loss to the Carolina Panthers would give them the #1 seed in the NFC. The game was close and hard-fought throughout the first half, but two key turnovers by the Bucs defense, a Barrett Ruud forced fumble of Saints running back Julius Jones near the Bucs' goal line and an interception of Saints quarterback Drew Brees near the end of the half, gave the Bucs the slight edge. A Saints field goal in the fourth quarter cut the Tampa Bay lead to 20\u201313, but with the Falcons holding a large lead over the Panthers, Saints coach Sean Payton chose to sit Brees and put in backup Chase Daniel. The Bucs held on and won the game 23\u201313, finishing the season with a 10\u20136 record, their best since 2005. However, the Packers and Giants both won close games as well, thus sending the eventual Super Bowl champion Packers to the playoffs. For the second time in three years, the Bucs had finished with a winning record, yet missed the playoffs. The season marked a 7-game improvement over the previous one, and was highlighted by the superb play of second-year quarterback Josh Freeman and a strong rookie class led by Gerald McCoy, Arrelious Benn, Mike Williams, Cody Grimm, and LeGarrette Blount. No Buccaneers were selected to the Pro Bowl, but left tackle Donald Penn did play in the game as a replacement for Green Bay's Chad Clifton, marking Penn's first appearance. Raheem Morris finished second in AP NFL Coach of the Year voting, and Mike Williams finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.",

The Indiana Pacers at Boston Celtics were scheduled to play on April 16, the day after the bombing. The NBA announced today that Tuesday night\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers game versus the Los Angeles Clippers has been postponed.  \"The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organization, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday,\" the league wrote in a statement.

He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States and as the 33rd Governor of New York . As a leader of the Republican Party during this time , he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century . His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore , alongside those of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and Abraham Lincoln .   Roosevelt was born a sickly child with debilitating asthma , but he successfully overcame his physical health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle . He integrated his exuberant personality , vast range of interests , and world-famous achievements into a `` cowboy '' persona defined by robust masculinity . Home-schooled , he began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending Harvard College . His book , The Naval War of 1812 -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer . Upon entering politics , he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York 's state legislature . Following the near-simultaneous deaths of his wife and mother , he escaped to a cattle ranch in the Dakotas . Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley , but resigned from that post to lead the Rough Riders during the Spanish -- American War . Returning a war hero , he was elected Governor of New York in 1898 . After the death of Vice President Garret Hobart , the New York state party leadership convinced McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his running mate in the 1900 election , moving Roosevelt to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president . Roosevelt campaigned vigorously and the McKinley-Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory based on a platform of peace , prosperity , and conservatism .   Following McKinley 's assassination in September 1901 , Roosevelt became president at age 42 , and remains the youngest president . As a leader of the Progressive movement , he championed his `` Square Deal '' domestic policies , promising the average citizen fairness , breaking of trusts , regulation of railroads , and pure food and drugs . Making conservation a top priority , he established a myriad of new national parks , forests , and monuments intended to preserve the nation 's natural resources . In foreign policy , he focused on Central America , where he began construction of the Panama Canal . He expanded the Navy and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States ' naval power around the globe . His successful efforts to broker the end of the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize . He avoided the controversial tariff and money issues . Elected in 1904 to a full term , Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies , but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress . Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend , William Howard Taft , and Taft won the 1908 presidential election to succeed him . In polls of historians and political scientists , Roosevelt is generally ranked as one of the five best presidents .   Frustrated with Taft 's conservatism , Roosevelt belatedly tried to win the 1912 Republican nomination . He failed , walked out , and founded a third party , the Progressive , so-called `` Bull Moose '' Party , which called for wide-ranging progressive reforms . The split allowed the Democrats to win the White House and a majority in both houses of Congress . Following his election defeat , Roosevelt led a two-year expedition to the Amazon basin , where he nearly died of tropical disease . During World War I , he criticized President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the country out of the war with Germany , and his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected . Though he had considered running for president again in 1920 , Roosevelt 's health continued to deteriorate , and he died in 1919 . ",

TRUE OR FALSE?  The viral video has been edited and shows only one portion of a longer speech where the Delhi chief minister spoke on his doubts about Congress\u2019 chances to win even a single seat in Delhi.  In fact, he goes on to say that neither Narendra Modi nor Rahul Gandhi would become the prime minister in 2019.  Although the full video could not be found at the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s page, it was found on another YouTube page.  Contrary to the claims (as shown) in the viral video clip, Kejriwal said Congress does not have a chance to win in Delhi, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.  He said it will, in fact, be the state parties that have the capability to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party.  He said, he would offer support to whoever becomes the PM, except Modi-Shah duo, and the only aim of the upcoming general elections should be to remove them from power.  Picking a PM candidate should not be the focus, he added.  (Not convinced of a story you came across on social media and want it verified?

Following the interwar period , Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World War II , suffering significant damage and casualties . Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union , which contributed to the establishment of a four-decade-long communist dictatorship -LRB- 1947 -- 1989 -RRB- . The country gained widespread international attention regarding the Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted border with Austria in 1989 , which accelerated the collapse of the Eastern Bloc . On 23 October 1989 , Hungary again became a democratic parliamentary republic .   In the 21st century , Hungary is a middle power and has the world 's 57th largest economy by nominal GDP , as well as the 58th largest by PPP , out of 188 countries measured by the IMF .

The Quint received a query about the claims on the same image via its WhatsApp helpline as well. TRUE OR FALSE? The claim made in the viral image is false. No such information was aired on Aaj Tak channel. The original still, which is from December 2016 when Narendra Modi was addressing the nation for the second time after demonetisation, has been morphed to spread a false narrative. WHAT WE FOUND OUT A reverse image search on Yandex revealed that the snapshot of PM Modi is from 31 December 2016. He had addressed the nation on that day for the second time after demonetisation was announced on 8 November 2016. A subsequent search on Google with the keywords \u2018\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940,\u2019 \u2018\u0928\u094b\u091f\u092c\u0902\u0926\u0940\u2019 and \u2018\u0906\u091c \u0924\u0915\u2019 (Translation: \u2018Modi,\u2019 \u2018Note bandi\u2019 and \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019) led to an Aaj Tak report that had the original still of the bulletin that was aired on the channel. In this video, at 05:16 minutes, the text in the top band of both the viral image and the original is same i.e. \u2018\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u0927\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f-2\u2019 ( Translation: Modi addresses the nation Part-2). However, the logo of Aaj Tak is different in both the images. Further, the way the attribution is made to DD News is different in both the images. In the original still, a red coloured text strip mentioning \u2018\u0938\u094c-\u0921\u0940\u0921\u0940\u2019\u2019can be seen but in the viral image, the blue coloured text strip mentions \u2018\u0938\u094c\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f-\u0921\u0940\u0921\u0940.\u2019 In the viral image, the portion where the claim about Modi banning liquor is mentioned, the original still reads a very different text. The text reads: \u2018\u0918\u0941\u091f\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u0932\u093e\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0925\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u2018 (Translation: People were in search of freedom from suffocation) This text is similar to the text mentioned in lower band of the viral image. The text in the lower band reads: \u2018\u0910\u0938\u0940 \u0918\u0941\u091f\u0928 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u0932\u093e\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0925\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0940\u2019\u2019 (Translation: The citizens of the country were in search of freedom from suffocation) Further, a source from Aaj Tak\u2019s digital team confirmed to The Quint that the still shown in the viral image is fake. He pointed out that the font size used in the ticker, top band and middle portion is different. Also, the time stamp on Aaj Tak\u2019s logo is cut in the viral image. Hence, the aforementioned observations prove that the still in the viral image is clearly morphed and was not aired on the channel. Also, Narendra Modi has not made any such claim that liquor has been banned in India. ",

    "evidence": "It\u2019s definitely not business as usual \u2014 and it is unlikely that it will not be for a few more months.Every Monday, for many weeks now, the Indian arm of Nomura Securities has been publishing a Business Resumption Index (called the Nomura India Business Resumption Index, or Nibri). The index has plateaued around 70 for the past month. By mid-June, it had come out of the slump it saw in April \u2014 it hit the mid-forties then \u2014 and reached the late-sixties, but it has pretty much stayed at that level since. The index value of 100 corresponds to pre-pandemic level business activity and as the firm points out \u201cthe pace at which economic activity normalises [has] remained broadly unchanged for the week ended July 26\u201d. It was 70 on July 19, 68.7 on July 12, 69.2 on July 5, and 70.5 on June 28.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia was locked down for 68 days between March 25 and May 31, although the second half of this period saw some activities being allowed in a restricted manner.The index\u2019s plateauing over the past month is an indication that India\u2019s return to economic recovery in 2020-21 will be slow, bumpy, and fraught with risks. Consensus estimates for the level by which the economy will decline this year are hovering around 5%, and some economists believe that the decline could be higher. It\u2019s hard to make predictions when there is still no certainty on when a cure will become available (although recent data from Phase 1 clinical trials of several vaccine candidates are promising).\u201cOverall, the Nibri suggests activity remains stuck at around 30 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels,\u201d the Nomura research report said.The data merely reflects the situation on the ground. A report in HT last week said that around half the country\u2019s population is under some form of lockdown \u2014 full, partial, or weekend \u2014 as local administrations deal with a sudden surge in cases.On Sunday, India saw in excess of 50,000 new coronavirus disease cases -- the first time it is crossing that mark, with 65% of the cases coming from states and Union Territories other than Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, which, together, used to account for 65% of the cases in the country not so long ago. Delhi\u2019s numbers have fallen sharply, but Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu\u2019s have risen just as sharply \u2014 which means that the contribution of the big three to India\u2019s Covid-19 tally is coming down because cases are rising in other parts of the country. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are all seeing a spike in new cases. Three of India\u2019s four most populous states are in this list; the one that isn\u2019t is Maharashtra, which saw 9,431 cases on Sunday \u2014 almost 19% of all new cases recorded in the country. Bihar, Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh \u201cface the immediate risk of becoming the new hot spots of the coronavirus disease in India\u201d, HT\u2019s Jamie Mullick wrote on July 27, pointing to factors that individually or together suggest this: \u201crapid rise in new cases, rising positivity rates, and low testing\u201d.Many of these states have been resorting to localised lockdowns to slow the spread of the disease. For instance, Uttar Pradesh announced a hard lockdown on weekends and also in some parts of the state where there are clusters of infections; West Bengal announced one for two days every week; Bihar is locked down till July 31, as are parts of Andhra Pradesh.It is only natural that lockdowns in India\u2019s most populous states affect activities, business or otherwise. And it is only natural that the Indian economy\u2019s return to normalcy is affected by the ongoing health crisis in its most industrialised state (Maharashtra), whose capital also happens to be the country\u2019s most important commercial hub.It will be a while before it is business as usual.Get our daily newsletterGet free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations",

    "evidence": "\n  US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un won\u2019t be able to replicate the historic nature of their first summit as they meet here in the Vietnamese capital on Wednesday. \n\n  But their second summit will serve as a real test of whether the two men are indeed converting the optimism of their first meeting into a credible diplomatic endeavor capable of bringing about the long-sought denuclearization of North Korea. \n\n  That remained in question as Trump arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday to meet with Kim for a summit that is kicking off amid high stakes and low expectations.  After months of high-level diplomacy, US officials have made clear that they do not yet know if North Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear weapons. \n\n  Here\u2019s what to watch as the two leaders meet face-to-face:\n\nTrump bets it all on friendship with Kim\n\n\n  Trump has consistently emphasized the importance of the personal relationship he has forged with Kim throughout his diplomatic engagement with North Korea. \n\n  He has referred to their written correspondence as \u201clove letters\u201d and praised Kim as \u201csmart\u201d and \u201ctough. \u201d And during their last summit, the two men played to the cameras with broad smiles, laughter and mutual pats on the back. \n\n  With another eight months of trust-building between the two countries and still more \u201clove letters\u201d exchanged, the personal chemistry between the two men is sure to take center stage once again \u2013 and expert observers will be analyzing every piece of body language. \n\n  While the second summit likely won\u2019t be able to deliver the drama of the first, the optics-conscious US President seeks to frame his second meeting with Kim as yet another show of his deal-making abilities. \n\n  Before a day of meetings on Thursday, Trump and Kim will sit down for dinner on Wednesday night, putting their one-on-one relationship at the center of the diplomatic effort. \n\n  But just as with the first summit, the stagecraft framing the summit in historic terms will also serve to elevate Kim to a position of prominence on the world stage, setting him on level footing with the American President and reducing his isolation among other world leaders. \n\nHigh stakes, low expectations for second Trump-Kim summit\n\n\n  But beyond the red-carpet treatment and the cheery chemistry that will likely color their meeting, the most persistent question hanging over Trump\u2019s second summit with the North Korean leader is simply: What will they achieve? \n\n  In the lead-up to the summit, senior Trump administration officials have sought to temper expectations, making clear that a dramatic leap toward the goal of denuclearization is not in the offing.  But the summit will nonetheless be a test of whether Trump and Kim can put some meat on the bones of the largely rhetorical accomplishments of their Singapore meeting. \n\n  US and North Korean officials have been hammering out the contents of a joint declaration for the two leaders to agree to in Hanoi, and the Singapore declaration will be used as a benchmark to evaluate the pace of progress.  If the Singapore declaration laid out the broad goals and areas of negotiation, how much more detail will the two leaders agree to in Hanoi?  What specific commitments will the two sides make toward achieving the goals they agreed to in Singapore? \n\n  US officials have been tight-lipped about the agreement that is coming together, but the second joint declaration could address: a mutually agreed definition of North Korean denuclearization, steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations, inspections at North Korean facilities, a freeze in North Korea\u2019s nuclear activities or formalizing the steps to achieve denuclearization and a reduction in US sanctions. \n\n  What\u2019s clear is that the US will be looking to establish a clear framework for North Korea to take steps toward denuclearization.  They are mindful that so far North Korea has yet to take any concrete and verifiable steps in that direction. \n\nDemocrats blast absent Trump with oversight offensive\n\n\n  Trump\u2019s arrival in Hanoi on Tuesday set the stage for the split-screen images that will define much of the Hanoi summit: At nearly the same time Trump touched down, his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen was arriving on Capitol Hill to give private testimony to senators about the President. \n\n  That imagery will be that much more jarring on Wednesday as Cohen testifies publicly before the House Oversight Committee. \n\n  Trump has vociferously slammed his longtime former aide as a liar and denied the allegations leveled against him \u2013 but how much will he be distracted by Cohen\u2019s testimony while in Vietnam? \n\n  Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown that Trump is focused on his summit with Kim. \n\n  \u201cI don\u2019t think Michael Cohen is occupying even 10% of his attention right now,\u201d Giuliani said. \n\n  But back in Washington at least, White House officials will be watching Cohen\u2019s public testimony and taking notes in case he wants to be briefed on the testimony, though a senior White House official said it\u2019s possible Trump will watch the hearing, which will start shortly after he wraps up a dinner with Kim in Hanoi.  \n\n  It won\u2019t be the first time the various investigations that have dogged Trump flared up while he is overseas.  Days before he departed for his first presidential trip abroad in 2017, the Justice Department named Mueller as special counsel.  A year later, as Trump was preparing to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland, the Justice Department announced it was indicting 12 Russian nationals on charges of hacking Democrats\u2019 emails.  And in December, Cohen pleaded guilty to a charge from Mueller\u2019s office days before Trump attended a leaders\u2019 summit in Argentina. \n\n  It\u2019s all led Trump to complain about the swirl of investigations, arguing it undermines his diplomatic effectiveness abroad. \n\n\n  While US and North Korean officials continued to hash out the contents of the joint declaration in the days before the summit, there\u2019s another reason why US officials have declined to preview likely areas of agreement.  And that\u2019s Trump\u2019s penchant for catching his own aides off guard. \n\n  In keeping with his \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d mantra \u2013 and his frequently dim view of the government\u2019s subject-matter experts \u2013 Trump has been known to jettison the carefully laid plans of his own government in favor of following his own instincts.  That much has been clear in Trump\u2019s handling of world affairs, from US policy toward NATO to his approach to Russia. \n\n  During the Singapore summit, Trump agreed on the spot to suspend joint US-South Korean exercises.  Trump and US officials had not previously planned to put the war games on the table, but Trump\u2019s in the moment move caught the US military\u2019s top brass and regional allies off guard. \n\n  Now, Trump\u2019s advisers have fretted about what surprise concession the President might make this time. \n\n  Among the most persistent concerns is that Trump would agree to reduce the US troop presence in South Korea.  Those fears were allayed when the US and South Korea reached a new cost-sharing agreement just weeks before the summit, but when asked whether Trump would put the issue on the table during his summit with Kim, senior administration officials have merely said it is not an issue they have discussed with their North Korean counterparts. \n\n\n  For Trump, if one half of his mission on the world stage is the diplomacy and the dealmaking, then the other half is the branding and salesmanship that the former reality TV star has so frequently brought to the presidency. \n\n  After the first summit in Singapore, Trump leaned into the historic nature of the first meeting between a sitting US president and North Korean leader.  In a news conference after the summit, Trump focused on his swing from bellicose orator to peace-loving dealmaker.  While the joint declaration offered little that North Korea had not previously agreed to, the symbolism of the summit helped back up his case. \n\n  But Trump also oversold the significance of the moment and his achievement, taking to Twitter as he made his way back to Washington to declare that \u201cthere is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. \u201d It is a point that top Trump administration officials have had to walk back as recently as Sunday, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged that a threat still exists. \n\n  Regardless of the extent of the progress this week, Trump is poised to sell the summit to the public as proof of his dealmaking abilities and evidence that he is disproving his critics.  After all, Trump has increasingly sought to cast the reduced tensions and ongoing diplomacy with North Korea as a victory in and of itself. \n\n  CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown contributed to this report. \n\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.

    "evidence": "Robert Browning -LRB- 7 May 1812 -- 12 December 1889 -RRB- was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets . His poems are known for their irony , characterization , dark humour , social commentary , historical settings , and challenging vocabulary and syntax .   Browning 's early career began promisingly , but was not a success . The long poem Pauline brought him to the attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti , and was followed by Paracelsus , which was praised by William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens , but in 1840 the difficult Sordello , which was seen as wilfully obscure , brought his poetry into disrepute . His reputation took more than a decade to recover , during which time he moved away from the Shelleyan forms of his early period and developed a more personal style .   In 1846 Browning married the older poet Elizabeth Barrett , who at the time was considerably better known than himself . So started one of history 's most famous literary marriages . They went to live in Italy , a country he called `` my university '' , and which features frequently in his work . By the time of her death in 1861 , he had published the crucial collection Men and Women . The collection Dramatis Personae and the book-length epic poem The Ring and the Book followed , and made him a leading British poet . He continued to write prolifically , but his reputation today rests largely on the poetry he wrote in this middle period .   When Browning died in 1889 , he was regarded as a sage and philosopher-poet who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social and political discourse -- as in the poem Caliban upon Setebos , which some critics have seen as a comment on the theory of evolution , which had recently been put forward by Darwin and others . Unusually for a poet , societies for the study of his work were founded while he was still alive . Such Browning Societies remained common in Britain and the United States until the early 20th century .   Browning 's admirers have tended to temper their praise with reservations about the length and difficulty of his most ambitious poems , particularly The Ring and the Book . Nevertheless , they have included such eminent writers as Henry James , Oscar Wilde , George Bernard Shaw , G. K. Chesterton , Ezra Pound , Jorge Luis Borges , and Vladimir Nabokov . Among living writers , Stephen King 's The Dark Tower series and A.S. Byatt 's Possession refer directly to Browning 's work .   Today Browning 's critically most esteemed poems include the monologues Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came , Fra Lippo Lippi , Andrea Del Sarto , and My Last Duchess . His most popular poems include Porphyria 's Lover , How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix , the diptych Meeting at Night , the patriotic Home Thoughts from Abroad , and the children 's poem The Pied Piper of Hamelin . His abortive dinner-party recital of How They Brought The Good News was recorded on an Edison wax cylinder , and is believed to be the oldest surviving recording made in the United Kingdom of a notable person .

    "evidence": "Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues\n\n\"Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues\" is a song written and performed by Danny O'Keefe.Of the prologue of songs originally planned, only \"Willkommen\" remained. One of the dropped numbers, \"I Don't Care Much\", was eventually restored to the 1987 production. \"Roommates\" was replaced by \"Perfectly Marvelous\", but largely serves the same purpose, for Sally to convince Cliff to let her move in with him. \"Good Time Charlie\" was to be sung by Sally to Cliff while they are on their way to Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider and Herr Schultz's engagement party, with Sally mocking the overly dour and pessimistic Cliff with the lines \"You're such a good time Charlie/What'll we do with you?/You're such a good-time Charlie/frolicking all the time...\"). \"It'll All Blow Over\" was planned for the end of the first act: Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider is concerned that marrying a Jew might not be wise, and Cliff is concerned about the city's growing Nazism. In the song, Sally tells them both that they have nothing to worry about and that all will turn out well in the end. She eventually convinces Cliff and Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider to sing the song with her. (Both this song and \"Roommates\" are occasionally underscored by the rhythm of the piece.) These three deleted songs were recorded by Kander and Ebb, and the sheet music for the songs was included in \"The Complete Cabaret Collection\", a book of vocal selections from the musical.",

    "evidence": "The Statue of Liberty -LRB- Liberty Enlightening the World ; -LSB- La Libert\u00e9 \u00e9clairant le monde , links = no -RSB- -RRB- is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City , in the United States . The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 .   The Statue of Liberty is a robed female figure representing Libertas , the Roman goddess . She holds a torch above her head , and in her left arm carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' -LRB- July 4 , 1776 -RRB- , the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence . A broken chain lies at her feet . The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States , and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad .   Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples . Due to the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. would provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions .   The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was constructed in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland .   The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service . Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916 . ",

    "evidence": "Austria -LRB- listen -RRB- , is a federal republic and a landlocked country of over 8.7 million people in Central Europe . It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north , Hungary and Slovakia to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . The territory of Austria covers 83879 km2 . The terrain is highly mountainous , lying within the Alps ; only 32 % of the country is below 500 m , and its highest point is 3798 m . The majority of the population speaks local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language , and Austrian German in its standard form is the country 's official language . Other local official languages are Hungarian , Burgenland Croatian , and Slovene .   The origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg dynasty , when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire . From the time of the Reformation , many northern German princes , resenting the authority of the Emperor , used Protestantism as a flag of rebellion . The Thirty Years War , the influence of the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of France , the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia , and the Napoleonic invasions all weakened the power of the Emperor in the north of Germany , but in the south , and in non-German areas of the Empire , the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control . During the 17th and 18th centuries , Austria retained its position as one of the great powers of Europe and , in response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French , the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804 . Following Napoleon 's defeat , Prussia emerged as Austria 's chief competitor for rule of a greater Germany . Austria 's defeat by Prussia at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz , during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 , cleared the way for Prussia to assert control over the rest of Germany . In 1867 , the empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary . After the defeat of France in the 1870-1 Franco-Prussian War , Austria was excluded from the new German Empire , although in the following decades , its politics , and its foreign policy , increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led Empire . During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28 , Austria-Hungary , emboldened by a pledge of German support , on July 28 declared war on Serbia because that country had not fully complied with an Austrian ultimatum . Austria was thus the first to go to war in the July Crisis , which would ultimately escalate into World War I.   After the collapse of the Habsburg -LRB- Austro-Hungarian -RRB- Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I , Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German-Austria -LRB- Deutsch\u00f6sterreich -RRB- , later changed to \u00d6sterreich , in an attempt at union with Germany , but this was forbidden under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye -LRB- 1919 -RRB- . The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919 . In 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss . This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945 , after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and Austria 's former democratic constitution was restored . In 1955 , the Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state , ending the occupation . In the same year , the Austrian Parliament created the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently neutral .   Today , Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states . The capital and largest city , with a population exceeding 1.7 million , is Vienna . Other major urban areas of Austria include Graz , Linz , Salzburg and Innsbruck . Austria is one of the richest countries in the world , with a nominal per capita GDP of $ 43,724 . The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2014 was ranked 21st in the world for its Human Development Index . Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 , joined the European Union in 1995 , and is a founder of the OECD . Austria also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995 , and adopted the euro currency in 1999 . , Vienna -LRB- -LSB- vi\u02c8\u025bn\u0259 -RSB- Wien , -LSB- vi\u02d0n -RSB- -RRB- is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria . Vienna is Austria 's primary city , with a population of about 1.8 million -LRB- 2.6 million within the metropolitan area , nearly one third of Austria 's population -RRB- , and its cultural , economic , and political centre . It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union . Until the beginning of the 20th century , it was the largest German-speaking city in the world , and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I , the city had 2 million inhabitants . Today , it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin . Vienna is host to many major international organizations , including the United Nations and OPEC . The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic , Slovakia , and Hungary . These regions work together in a European Centrope border region . Along with nearby Bratislava , Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants . In 2001 , the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site .   Apart from being regarded as the City of Music because of its musical legacy , Vienna is also said to be `` The City of Dreams '' because it was home to the world 's first psycho-analyst -- Sigmund Freud . The city 's roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city , and then the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading European music centre , from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century . The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles , including Baroque castles and gardens , and the late-19th-century Ringstra\u00dfe lined with grand buildings , monuments and parks .   Vienna is known for its high quality of life . In a 2005 study of 127 world cities , the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first -LRB- in a tie with Vancouver , Canada and San Francisco , USA -RRB- for the world 's most liveable cities . Between 2011 and 2015 , Vienna was ranked second , behind Melbourne , Australia .  For eight consecutive years -LRB- 2009 -- 2016 -RRB- , the human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Vienna first in its annual `` Quality of Living '' survey of hundreds of cities around the world , a title the city still held in 2016 . Monocle 's 2015 `` Quality of Life Survey '' ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world `` to make a base within . ''   The UN-Habitat has classified Vienna as being the most prosperous city in the world in 2012/2013 .  The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008 , and sixth globally -LRB- out of 256 cities -RRB- in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index , which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas : culture , infrastructure , and markets . Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners .   Between 2005 and 2010 , Vienna was the world 's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions . It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year . , Bratislava -LRB- -LSB- \u02ccbr\u00e6t\u1d7b\u02c8sl\u0251\u02d0v\u0259 -RSB- or -LSB- \u02ccbr\u0251\u02d0 - -RSB- -LSB- \u02c8bracisla\u028ba -RSB- ; also known by other names -RRB- is the capital of Slovakia , and with a population of about 450,000 , the country 's largest city . The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people . Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia , occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava . Bordering Austria and Hungary , it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states .   The history of the city has been strongly influenced by people of different nations and religions , namely by Austrians , Croats , Czechs , Germans , Hungarians , Jews , Serbs and Slovaks -LRB- in alphabetical order -RRB- . The city served as the coronation site and legislative center of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1536 to 1783 , and has been home to many Slovak , Hungarian and German historical figures .   Bratislava is the political , cultural and economic centre of Slovakia . It is the seat of the Slovak president , the parliament and the Slovak Executive . It is home to several universities , museums , theatres , galleries and other important cultural and educational institutions . Many of Slovakia 's large businesses and financial institutions also have headquarters there .   The capital of Slovakia is the eighth best city for freelancers to live in , mostly because of fast internet and the low taxes . In 2017 , Bratislava was ranked as the third richest region of the European Union by GDP -LRB- PPP -RRB- per capita -LRB- after Hamburg and Luxembourg City -RRB- . GDP at purchasing power parity is about three times higher than in other Slovak regions . ",

FACT-CHECK    Using InVid, a video verification tool, we broke the video into key frames and performed a reverse image search and found a similar video which was uploaded on November 1, 2017 stating that it was a mock drill by Jharkhand's Khunti Police.       Additionally, the search results showed that the same video was previously viral with the false claim that it showed Madhya Pradesh police firing at farmers in Mandsaur. This claim was debunked by Alt News on July 11, 2018.    In this second video titled 'Jharkhand police KHUNTI (part of traning) REHEARSAL' uploaded on November 4, 2017, one can view the training exercise from a different angle. The video also shows the protesters chanting slogans.       On observing the video, one can confirm that it is a mock drill as people can be spotted recording the event on their mobile phones.     At the 0.50 timestamp one can also spot people walking past as the police is charging towards the protesters.     After shots are fired by the police at the 16 seconds timestamp, no blood spill or shot wounds can be spotted as the police put a protester on a stretcher.     Signboards of shops in the background can be spotted in Hindi, whereas shops in Kashmir mostly have signboards in Urdu.     Additionally in the viral video, one can spot 'Allahabad bank' at the seven seconds mark. Using Google Maps, we could locate the street on which the bank branch lies in Khunti, Jharkhand.

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "By Rob Picheta and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1, CNNHistoric ruling: The Supreme Court has ruled that Boris Johnson suspended UK Parliament unlawfully.  The landmark decision was unanimous. Calls for Johnson to resign: Reacting to this morning's ruling, opposition politicians called on the Prime Minister to resign. Johnson's controversial decision: The PM had claimed he shut down Parliament to prepare for a new session, but critics said it was to stifle opposition over Brexit. From CNN's Livvy DohertyPrime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with the Queen on the phone from New York on Tuesday, according to a Downing Street spokesperson. The call followed the UK Supreme Court ruling that Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue the Parliament was unlawful. \u00a0Details of their call will not be released, the spokesperson said.  As far as dodges go, the one made by the\u00a0United Kingdom's Supreme Court\u00a0on Tuesday was, well, supreme. The country's highest court managed to stay clear of accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of misleading Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 yet still ruled on Tuesday morning that his\u00a0decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful. Get the whole story here. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. The border between Ireland, which will remain EU member, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, is the biggest sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.  Varadkar said there's still a \"wide gap\" between the EU and the UK.  The UK Attorney General's office said the government \"acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional\" when it decided to suspend Parliament. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is the government's chief legal advisor.  As such, he would have likely played a role in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision, advising him whether or not he believed the prorogation was legal. Cox told the government the move would be legal, Sky News reported on Tuesday.  CNN could not independently verify that claim. Cox's office did not address that question.  In the statement, it said:Analysis from CNN's\u00a0Luke McGeeAt the end of the\u00a0worst day in his professional life,\u00a0many in the UK are asking: How long can the British Prime Minister stay in his job? It's a reasonable question to ask of the British Prime Minister.  The man who can barely go a week without suffering some kind of political setback faced his biggest public embarrassment on Tuesday, as the UK's highest court ruled that his decision to unilaterally suspend Parliament was unlawful.  Worse, he might have\u00a0misled the Queen in doing so. Under normal circumstances, you'd expect leader so under fire to realize their time was up.  But Brexit has created some pretty abnormal circumstances in Westminster. Read the full analysis here. Boris Johnson will not be able to force through a no-deal Brexit without Parliament\u2019s consent, former Conservative lawmaker Rory Stewart has told CNN. Stewart told Richard Quest the Supreme Court verdict \u201cexposed the fundamental flaw\u201d in Johnson\u2019s strategy.  \u201cHe somehow convinced himself that he could suspend Parliament, ignore Parliament and try to ram it through. \u201d\u201cOur elected body is Parliament,\u201d added Stewart, who challenged Johnson in this summer's Conservative leadership contest.  \u201cParliament is sovereign . . .  if Parliament doesn\u2019t want a no-deal Brexit, you can\u2019t have a no-deal Brexit. \u201dStewart also accused Trump of \u201cgetting into Trumpian territory . . .  he\u2019s now doing things which are very very unprecedented. \u201dHe added that Johnson should resign.  But he went on: \u201cI ran against him in the leadership, he\u2019s just fired me form his political party and I think he\u2019s a dangerous man.  So obviously that would be my view, but obviously I\u2019m not the person to ask. \u201dStewart was one of several lawmakers expelled form the Conservative Party by Johnson after voting to block a no-deal split. President Donald Trump played down suggestions that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson should resign after he was found to have unlawfully suspended Parliament.  Asked how he responded to calls for him to go, Johnson told reporters at the UN General Assembly, \u201cwe respect the judiciary in our country,\u201d before adding that he disagrees \"profoundly\" with the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump also said Johnson\u2019s difficulties are \u201cpretty much what you expected\u201d from the Brexit process, and added he will make great progress on Brexit come October and November -- to which Johnson quickly interjected, \u201cOctober!  October! \u201dTrump then repeated his false claim that he had predicted the result of the Brexit vote in Britain before polls closed.  \u201cI was there, I happened to be there the day of the vote . . .  I even made a prediction.  It was a correct prediction,\u201d Trump said.  Trump had in fact been in the UK the day after the result. The President said he had \"no reaction\" to the Supreme Court ruling, calling it \"another day at the office for Johnson. \"He then discussed his own administration's \"0 for 7\" start in the Supreme Court, before he got a \"great streak going\" with the body, suggesting the same turnaround will come for Johnson. \"We're full of respect for the justices of our Supreme Court,\" Johnson interrupted, prompting Trump to laugh and tap him on the shoulder.  \"He's being very nice to the courts,\" Trump said with a smile.  From CNN's Eliza Mackintosh in Brighton, EnglandJeremy Corbyn has now moved onto Labour's domestic agenda, setting out his pitch for an early election that looks more likely by the day. \"Nothing matters more than the climate emergency,\" he says, praising Greta Thunberg and other young activists who have been staging strikes in recent months. \"We're seeing ice caps melting, coral reefs dissolving, wildfires in the Arctic Circle and Brazil's far-right leader President Bolsonaro fiddles while the Amazon burns. \"\"Real security doesn't come from belligerent posturing or reckless military interventions.  It comes from international cooperation and diplomacy, and addressing the root causes of the threats we all face. \"He also discusses Labour's domestic policy, to applause from the hall. From CNN's Eliza Mackintosh in Brighton, England\"I don't think he's fit to be prime minister,\" Jeremy Corbyn says of Boris Johnson during his keynote conference speech. \"This crisis can only be solved with a general election.  That election needs to take place as soon as this government's threat of a disastrous no deal is off the table,\" Corbyn says, restating his party's position on a snap poll. Corbyn then warns of the effects of a no-deal Brexit, saying it would leave Britain subservient to the United States in trade talks. Johnson wants to put Britain \"at the mercy of Donald Trump,\" Corbyn says.  \"A no-deal Brexit is in reality a Trump-deal Brexit,\"\"That would be the opposite of taking back control,\" says Corbyn, adding that Trump us \"delighted\" to have Boris Johnson \"in his back pocket. \"He also nods to his own party's Brexit policy, which many observers have pointed out has been anything but unified. Corbyn promises a second confirmatory vote, featuring two options: \"credible leave alongside remain. \"\"That's not complicated,\" he says, adding that he will carry out whatever the people decide.

The film is set in the mid-22nd century , when humans are colonizing Pandora , a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system , in order to mine the mineral unobtanium , a room-temperature superconductor .

    "evidence": "The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn -LRB- Ordo Hermeticus Aurorae Aureae or , more commonly , The Golden Dawn -LRB- Aurora Aurea -RRB- -RRB- was an organization devoted to the study and practice of the occult , metaphysics , and paranormal activities during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Known as a magical order , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development . Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions , such as Wicca and Thelema , were inspired by the Golden Dawn , which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism .   The three founders , William Robert Woodman , William Wynn Westcott , and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers , were Freemasons and members of Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia -LRB- S.R.I.A. -RRB- . Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn .   The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the Masonic Lodges ; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men . The `` Golden Dawn '' was the first of three Orders , although all three are often collectively referred to as the `` Golden Dawn '' . The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four Classical Elements as well as the basics of astrology , tarot divination , and geomancy . The Second or `` Inner '' Order , the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis -LRB- the Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold -RRB- , taught magic , including scrying , astral travel , and alchemy . The Third Order was that of the `` Secret Chiefs '' , who were said to be highly skilled ; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order . , The occult -LRB- from the Latin word occultus `` clandestine , hidden , secret '' -RRB- is `` knowledge of the hidden . '' In common English usage , occult refers to `` knowledge of the paranormal , '' as opposed to `` knowledge of the measurable , '' usually referred to as science . The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that `` is meant only for certain people '' or that `` must be kept hidden '' , but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences . The terms esoteric and arcane can also be used to describe the occult , in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural .   It also describes a number of magical organizations or orders , the teachings and practices taught by them , and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject .

First popularized around 1901 , Lebensraum became a geopolitical goal of Imperial Germany in World War I -LRB- 1914 -- 1918 -RRB- originally , as the core element of the Septemberprogramm of territorial expansion . The most extreme form of this ideology was supported by the Nazi Party -LRB- NSDAP -RRB- and Nazi Germany until the end of World War II .   Following Adolf Hitler 's rise to power Lebensraum became an ideological principle of Nazism , and provided justification for the German territorial expansion into East-Central Europe . The Nazi Generalplan Ost policy -LRB- the Master Plan for the East -RRB- was based on its tenets . It stipulated that most of the indigenous populations of Eastern Europe would have to be removed permanently -LRB- either through mass deportation to Siberia , death , or enslavement -RRB- including Polish , Ukrainian , Russian , and other Slavic nations considered racially inferior and non-Aryan . The Nazi government aimed at repopulating these lands with Germanic colonists in the name of Lebensraum during World War II and thereafter . The entire populations were to be decimated by starvation , allowing for their own agricultural surplus to feed Germany .   Hitler 's strategic program for world domination was based on the belief in the power of Lebensraum , pursued by a racially superior society . People deemed to be part of inferior races , within the territory of Lebensraum expansion , were subjected to expulsion or destruction . The eugenics of Lebensraum assumed the right of the German Aryan master race -LRB- Herrenvolk -RRB- to remove indigenous people they considered to be of inferior racial stock -LRB- Untermenschen -RRB- in the name of their own living space . Nazi Germany also supported other ` Aryan ' nations ' pursuing their own Lebensraum , including Fascist Italy 's Spazio vitale . , Adolf Hitler -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8ad\u0254lf \u02c8h\u026atl\u0250 -RSB- ; 20 April 1889 -- 30 April 1945 -RRB- was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party -LRB- Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ; NSDAP -RRB- , Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 , and F\u00fchrer -LRB- `` Leader '' -RRB- of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945 . As dictator of the German Reich , he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , and was central to the Holocaust .   Hitler was born in Austria , then part of Austria-Hungary , and raised near Linz . He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I . He joined the German Workers ' Party -LRB- DAP -RRB- , the precursor of the NSDAP , in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921 . In 1923 he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power . The failed coup resulted in Hitler 's imprisonment , during which he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf -LRB- `` My Struggle '' -RRB- . After his release in 1924 , Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism , anti-semitism , and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda . Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy .   By 1933 , the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag , which led to Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 . Following fresh elections won by his coalition , the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act , which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany , a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism . Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France . His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression , the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I , and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans -- actions which gave him significant popular support .   Hitler sought Lebensraum -LRB- `` living space '' -RRB- for the German people in Eastern Europe . His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe . He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland , resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany . In June 1941 , Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union . By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa . Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats . In the final days of the war , during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 , Hitler married his long-time lover , Eva Braun . On 30 April 1945 , less than two days later , the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army , and their corpses were burned .   Under Hitler 's leadership and racially motivated ideology , the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen -LRB- `` sub-humans '' -RRB- and socially undesirable . Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war . In addition , 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II . The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare , and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history . ",

    "evidence": "Evil , in a general context is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good . Often , evil denotes profound immorality . In certain religious contexts , evil has been described as a supernatural force . Definitions of evil vary , as does the analysis of its motives . However , elements that are commonly associated with evil involve unbalanced behavior involving anger , revenge , fear , hatred , psychological trauma , expediency , selfishness , ignorance , or neglect .   In cultures with an Abrahamic religious influence , evil is usually perceived as the dualistic antagonistic opposite of good , in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated .

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Iran -LRB- \u026a , also \u026a -RRB- , formerly known as Persia , is a sovereign state in Western Asia . It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia , the de facto Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan ; to the north by the Caspian Sea ; to the northeast by Turkmenistan ; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan ; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman ; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq . Comprising a land area of 1648195 km2 , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world . Officially with 79.93 million inhabitants -LRB- Nov 2016 -RRB- , Iran is the world 's 18th-most-populous country . It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline . The country 's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia , and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz , make it of great geostrategic importance . Iran has diverse landscapes and geographical conditions . Tehran is the country 's capital and largest city , as well as its leading economic and cultural center .   Iran is home to one of the world 's oldest civilizations , beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the 4th millennium BC . The area was first unified and dominated by the Iranian Medes in the 7th century BC . Iran reached its greatest extent during the Achaemenid Empire -LRB- First Persian Empire -RRB- founded by Cyrus the Great in 6th century BC , the largest empire the world had yet seen , stretching from Eastern Europe to the Indus Valley . Persia fell to Alexander the Great in 4th century BC , but reemerged shortly after as the Parthian Empire . Under the Sassanians , Persia became a leading world power for the next four centuries .   In 7th century AD , Arabs conquered Persia and largely displaced the indigenous faiths of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism with the new religion of Islam . Iranians became major contributors to the Islamic Golden Age that followed , producing many influential scientists , scholars , artists and thinkers . After two centuries , a period of various Iranian dynasties began , although these dynasties were later conquered by Turks and then the Mongols . An Iranian national identity was always reasserted however , developing a distinct cultural entity . The rise of the Safavids in 15th century led to the establishment of Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion , marking a turning point in Muslim history . In the 18th century , Iran arguably possessed briefly the most powerful military at the time under Nader Shah . Conflicts with the Russian Empire in 19th century led to significant territorial losses . Popular unrest culminated in the Persian Constitutional Revolution , which established a constitutional monarchy and the country 's first legislative body , the Majles . Following a coup d'\u00e9tat instigated by the UK and the US in 1953 , Iran gradually became closely aligned with the West and grew increasingly autocratic . Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of an Islamic republic , a political system which combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a theocracy governed by Islamic jurists under the concept of a `` Supreme Leadership '' . According to international observers , the current Iranian government is oppressive , with human rights abuses commonplace .   A multicultural country comprising numerous ethnic and linguistic groups , most inhabitants of Iran are Shia Muslims and Persian is the official language . The largest ethnic groups in Iran are the Persians , Azeris , Kurds and Lurs .   Iran is a founding member of the UN , ECO , NAM , OIC , and OPEC . Iran is a major regional and middle power , and its large reserves of fossil fuels -- which include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves -- exert considerable influence in international energy security and the world economy . Iran 's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites , the third-largest number in Asia and 11th-largest in the world . ",

    "evidence": "Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez -LRB- born July 27 , 1975 -RRB- , nicknamed `` A-Rod '' , is a Dominican-American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman . He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- for the Seattle Mariners , Texas Rangers , and New York Yankees . Rodriguez was one of the sport 's most highly touted prospects and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time . During his 22-year career , Rodriguez has amassed a .297 batting average , 696 home runs , over 2,000 runs batted in -LRB- RBI -RRB- , over 2,000 runs scored , and over 3,000 hits . He is a 14-time All-Star and has won three American League -LRB- AL -RRB- Most Valuable Player -LRB- MVP -RRB- Awards , ten Silver Slugger Awards , and two Gold Glove Awards . Rodr\u00edguez is the career record holder for grand slams with 25 . However , he has led a highly controversial career due to signing two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history while incurring criticism from the media for his behavior and use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs .   The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft , and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18 . In 1996 , he became the Mariners ' starting shortstop and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award . Rodriguez 's combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers . The 10-year , $ 252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history . He played at a high level in his three years with Texas , highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003 , but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure . Prior to the 2004 season , Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees , for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop Derek Jeter . In his first four seasons with New York , he was twice more named AL MVP . After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season , Rodriguez signed a new 10-year , $ 275 million deal with the Yankees , extending his record for the sport 's most lucrative contract . He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs , reaching the milestone in 2007 . He won his first World Series in 2009 , which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium . The following year , he became the career leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent . In recent years , Rodriguez has been hampered by hip and knee injuries , which have caused him to exclusively become a designated hitter . He played his final game as a Yankee on August 12 , 2016 .   In February 2009 , after previously denying use of performance-enhancing drugs , including during a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes , Rodriguez admitted to using steroids , saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for Rangers due to `` an enormous amount of pressure '' to perform . While recovering from a hip injury in 2013 , Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal . In August 2013 , MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the scandal , but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment . Had the original suspension been upheld , it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history . After an arbitration hearing , the suspension was reduced to 162 games , keeping him off the field for the entire 2014 season . ",

    "claim": "taylor swift's latest album is named taylor swift.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "One of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"Tim McGraw,\" was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Swift released her first studio album, \"Taylor Swift\", which spent 275 weeks on Billboard 200, one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, \"Fearless\", which made her the second-longest Number One charted on Billboard 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind Adele's \"21\") within the past 5 years. At the 2010 Grammys, Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for \"Fearless\", which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten Grammys already. Buoyed by her teen idol status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the \"Billboard\" charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart of any song in nearly five decades. The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album \"1989\" (2014), \"Reputation\" (2017), \"Lover\" (2019) were released solely to pop audiences.\"Taylor Swift\" was released on October 24, 2006 with eleven tracks. Swift was highly involved in the album packaging, designing doodle graphics herself. She also personally capitalized specific letters in the lyrics from each song to spell out hidden messages, a feat she would also execute for her succeeding albums. On November 6, 2007, the album was released under the title \"Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition\" for a limited time. The deluxe edition contained three new songs: \"I'm Only Me When I'm with You\", \"Invisible\" and \"A Perfectly Good Heart\", the radio edits for \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", and \"Our Song\", and Swift's first phone conversation with Tim McGraw. The release also bore new artwork and a bonus DVD with all of Swift's music videos at the time (\"Tim McGraw\", \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", and \"Our Song\"), behind-the-scenes footage of \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and \"Our Song\" music videos, and a performance of \"Picture to Burn\", among other material. The American retail company Target released an exclusive version of \"Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition\", with performances of Swift during McGraw and Hill's Soul2Soul II Tour. A third and final edition appeared on March 18, 2008 with the original album artwork, including the three new songs from the \"Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition\", as well as the radio edit of \"Picture to Burn,\" and an additional pop remix of \"Teardrops on My Guitar\". This version of the album was also released on vinyl in 2016. A karaoke version of \"Taylor Swift\" was released on January 27, 2009, containing the first fourteen tracks from the album on both CD+G and DVD.",

Reverse image search on the screenshots of the video led us to a social media post published on 17 April 2021, which mentions that the video is from Anjuman Masjid in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh.  Google search with relevant keywords led us to a tweet by UP Tak which had a similar video.

In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon -LRB- \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd , Lakeda\u00edm\u014dn -RRB- , while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia , in south-eastern Peloponnese . Around 650 BC , it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece .   Given its military pre-eminence , Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian Wars . Between 431 and 404 BC , Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War , from which it emerged victorious , though at a great cost of lives lost . Sparta 's defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta 's prominent role in Greece . However , it maintained its political independence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC . It then underwent a long period of decline , especially in the Middle Ages , when many Spartans moved to live in Mystras . Modern Sparta is the capital of the Greek regional unit of Laconia and a center for the processing of goods such as citrus and olives .   Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution , which completely focused on military training and excellence . Its inhabitants were classified as Spartiates -LRB- Spartan citizens , who enjoyed full rights -RRB- , mothakes -LRB- non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans -RRB- , perioikoi -LRB- freedmen -RRB- , and helots -LRB- state-owned serfs , enslaved non-Spartan local population -RRB- . Spartiates underwent the rigorous agoge training and education regimen , and Spartan phalanges were widely considered to be among the best in battle . Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world .   Sparta was the subject of fascination in its own day , as well as in the West following the revival of classical learning . This love or admiration of Sparta is known as Laconism or Laconophilia .  At its peak around 500 BC the size of the city would have been some 20,000 -- 35,000 free residents , plus numerous helots and perioikoi -LRB- `` dwellers around '' -RRB- . At 40,000 -- 50,000 it was one of the largest Greek cities ; however , according to Thucydides , the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000 -- 610,000 , making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 5th century BC . The French classicist Fran\u00e7ois Ollier in his 1933 book Le mirage spartiate -LRB- `` The Spartan Mirage '' -RRB- warned that a major scholarly problem regarding Sparta is that all the surviving accounts of Sparta were written by non-Spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of Sparta . Ollier 's theory of the `` Spartan mirage '' has been widely accepted by scholars . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "  A recent tweet by Anand Mahindra, founder of Mahindra and Mahindra group of companies claiming a mask he had been gifted \"destroys viruses\" is false. His tweet was criticised by a few medical professionals as masks have not been proven to destroy any such viruses.  Mahindra in his tweet included a picture of the mask a - N95 - and thanked a friend for gifting it to him.  The ongoing hysteria around COVID-19, a Coronavirus strain that has impacted over 158 countries, has led to people actively hoarding masks and wearing them for regular use which are even inducing a sense of fear among people who are not currently wearing masks. The prices of the masks have also sky-rocketed. The World Health Organization has also stated that masks do not kill any viruses and should only be worn by people who are either exhibiting symptoms of the virus or are tending to the sick.  Mahindra found himself in the line of crossfire as his tweet stated that these reusable, washable masks had the ability to \"destroy viruses.\" These masks are being made by a company called Livinguard whose board member Ashok Kurien gifted this \"anti-pollution\" N95 mask to Mahindra.  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd to my friend Ashok Kurien, who sent me the best gift for these times! Proud to learn that an Indian inventor's Swiss company has come out with these washable,reusable masks that destroy viruses. They're stepping up production in India. https://t.co/uZv23cAM7j pic.twitter.com/YFawmDhvcY Mahindra received backlash as Twitter users requested him to not promote news which was not scientifically backed. Mr. Mahindra No mask that we know of can \"destroy the virus\" as you have written in your post. Kindly correct this ASAP since you are a public personality. All masks only assist in personal protection from air borne infection. Also Read: No, Cristiano Ronaldo's Hotels Will Not Be Turned Into Hospitals For Coronavirus Patients     Mahindra's claim that masks kill viruses has no scientific backing. The primary role of masks is to not allow microbial particles to pass through the filter designed in the masks, according to the Centres of Disease Control and Prevention, United States of America BOOM also looked up the mask gifted to Mahindra and found that it is a N95 mask made by Livinguard. The company makes masks for protection against air pollution and are useful for protecting against the polluting agents as they are made according to the size of the particles in the air. The website clearly mentions that they work on bacteria and fungi thriving on filters but do not mention viruses.  In their medical textiles, the company makes scrubs and clothing but does not specifically mention masks.  The World Health Organization has stated that healthy individuals only need to wear a mask if they are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection. People coughing or sneezing should wear a mask. There is no proof that masks kill the virus.   WHO also further stated that wearing masks would only be effective if used along with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. The WHO also emphasized that people wearing masks should also know how to wear and dispose one. COVID-19  is transmitted through the droplet mode of transmission which rest on surfaces. If an unhealthy person, not wearing a mask, sneezes or coughs in one's vicinity, the droplets could even settle on the mask of a person wearing one. If the person then touches the mask and later touches their face, there is a possibility of the virus spreading to the person.   Many media organizations have reported about how the prices of masks have escalated due to people buying many masks. Economic Times reported that people claimed surgical masks which usually sell for Rs 10 were being sold for Rs 40 or higher, and N95 masks which sell for around Rs 150 were being sold for up to Rs 500. People have also been hoarding masks and sanitisers.  The Government of India even added face masks and sanitizers to its list of essential items to control its burgeoning prices, as reported by PTI.

Its urban area extends beyond the city 's administrative limits with a population of around 2.7 million people , being the 11th-most populous urban area in the European Union . About 2.8 million people live in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area -LRB- which represents approximately 27 % of the country 's population -RRB- . It is continental Europe 's westernmost capital city and the only one along the Atlantic coast . Lisbon lies in the western Iberian Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean and the River Tagus . The westernmost areas of its metro area is the westernmost point of Continental Europe .   Lisbon is recognised as a global city because of its importance in finance , commerce , media , entertainment , arts , international trade , education and tourism . It is one of the major economic centres on the continent , with a growing financial sector and one of the largest container ports on Europe 's Atlantic coast . Humberto Delgado Airport serves over 20 million passengers annually , as of 2015 , and the motorway network and the high-speed rail system of Alfa Pendular link the main cities of Portugal . The city is the 7th-most-visited city in Southern Europe , after Istanbul , Rome , Barcelona , Madrid , Athens and Milan , with 1,740,000 tourists in 2009 . The Lisbon region contributes with a higher GDP PPP per capita than any other region in Portugal .

Julius Caesar made it a municipium called Felicitas Julia , adding to the name Olissipo . Ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century , it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century . In 1147 , the Crusaders under Afonso Henriques reconquered the city and since then it has been a major political , economic and cultural centre of Portugal . Unlike most capital cities , Lisbon 's status as the capital of Portugal has never been granted or confirmed officially -- by statute or in written form . Its position as the capital has formed through constitutional convention , making its position as de facto capital a part of the Constitution of Portugal .   Lisbon enjoys a Mediterranean climate . It has one of the warmest winters of any metropolis in Europe , with average temperatures 15 \u00b0 C during the day and 8 \u00b0 C at night from December to February .

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "BJP president JP Nadda\u2019s formal announcement of fighting the Tamil Nadu assembly elections, expected in April-May this year, in alliance with the state\u2019s ruling AIADMK, has put the focus back on the saffron party\u2019s bid to gain a foothold in a state it has found difficult to penetrate.  Nadda, and the party he leads, are hoping to cash in on the Centre\u2019s social welfare and other centrally-sponsored schemes to earn an edge over the opposition in Tamil Nadu, where its presence is nascent. The benefits that it accrued in state elections held recently in Bihar, where the delivery of central schemes, especially those targeted at women, were credited for helping script the National Democratic Alliance\u2019s victory, have raised the party\u2019s hopes of benefitting from the delivery of funds for programmes such as housing in rural and urban areas; PM Kisan Nidhi and urban infrastructure. This is in addition to the women specific schemes that the AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa had introduced in her six terms as chief minister.  Tamil Nadu has a history of schemes such as free medicines, health insurance and pension to the needy, which were later replicated nationally.  However, the AIADMK has been facing allegations of corruption in implementation of these schemes. A senior BJP functionary, speaking on condition of anonymity, said though the party has opted to contest the 2021 assembly election as an ally of the ruling AIADMK; it will focus on the impact of centrally sponsored schemes on providing livelihood, housing, and improving urban infrastructure. \u201cThe opposition created falsehoods about the state being neglected.  Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi himself set the record straight (in 2018), when he said that there has been an increase of about 120% in the allocation for the state.  When the Congress-led UPA was in power at the centre, Tamil Nadu got just \u20b981,000 crore under the 13th Finance Commission, but under the BJP-led NDA regime, it increased to \u20b9180,000 crore under the 14th Finance Commission,\u201d the functionary said. The assertion that the state has been better-off under the NDA rule was made again in November this year by Union home minister Amit Shah during his visit to Chennai.  Shah, who laid foundation stones for various infrastructure projects worth about Rs.  70,000 crore said, \u201cThe schemes and funds provided to Tamil Nadu by the Central government are not meant for help, but it is the right of Tamil Nadu that was not being given to it.  Modi ji ensured that now Tamil Nadu gets its rights. \"He cited numbers to buttress the claims.  15% of Tamil Nadu's 1. 42 crore rural households had drinking water connections thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s scheme for piped water in every household, he said, adding that by 2024 drinking water will be provided to 1. 20 crore families. He also stated that while the previous government had waived off loans of only 60,000 crore in 10 years, the Modi government has transferred \u20b995,000 crore directly into the bank account of farmers in three years, of which, about \u20b94,404 crore has been directly transferred to 45 lakh farmers of Tamil Nadu. During the party\u2019s month-long Vetrivel Yatra (victorious spear march), the leaders made an effort to highlight several central programmes, including the Ujjwala Yojana and the Individual Household Latrine scheme.  However, response to the yatra was tepid. Both the BJP and the AIADMK may have to navigate through the allegations of corruption and leaks in the implementation of some of these schemes. For instance, in September, the Centre was quick to nudge the state government to undertake an enquiry after a scam in the allocation of monies under the PM Kisan scheme was unearthed.  This came after the state government said approximately \u20b9110 crore had been credited to the bank accounts of about 5. 5 lakh ineligible people, who had fraudulently registered under the PM Kisan scheme in 13 districts of the state. To counter any negative narrative against the party, the BJP Tamil Nadu president L Murugan launched \u2018Farmers\u2019 friend Modi\u2019 campaign in Madurai to explain the three new farm laws across districts alleging the DMK and Congress were misleading the farmers. In the ruling All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\u2019s last full-fledged budget, deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam, who handles the finance portfolio, set apart \u20b96,500 crore for food subsidy and announced a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to manage the Amma Canteens.  \u201cWhile there are several central schemes spread across all departments which are implemented by the state, most people seem to have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM- KISAN) and Awas Yojana,\u201d said an AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity. But, the focus on the centrally-sponsored schemes is also expected to shield the BJP from any possible anti-incumbency against the AIADMK; to make up for the lack of a structured party cadre on the ground; to alter its image of a Hindi-speaking, upper-caste party. Opposition DMK, however, dismissed notions that there was any traction for BJP government\u2019s schemes on the ground.  \u201cThere was massive fraud in the PM Kisan scheme.  If it is BJP\u2019s pet scheme, serious investigations should have followed, but we don\u2019t know what is happening,\u201d said DMK spokesperson A Saravanan. Saravanan pointed out that there was no toilet in the Kancheepuram agriculture department\u2019s office, where a government employee with disability, S Saranya died after she fell into an open septic tank in December last, as a case of failure of the central government schemes. Also Read: 'BJP, AIADMK will contest together in Tamil Nadu': NaddaPolitical commentator Sumanth C Raman, however, said that banking on the centrally-sponsored schemes for the state elections is unlikely to be rewarding for the BJP, as there is little resonance of their benefits on the ground.  \u201cThe benefits of these schemes are not talked about.  The local media is very hostile to the BJP and they don\u2019t document the schemes or the benefits they have offered to the people in the state,\u201d he said. Raman also said the state leadership has begun to focus on the rural areas, where the party\u2019s presence was weak. In Tamil Nadu, BJP continues to attack the DMK on religious grounds, dynasty politics and the 2G spectrum scam.  The party has limited issues to take up since it is in alliance with the ruling AIADMK.  In the 2016 assembly elections, BJP was a no-show with a vote share of 2. 8%.  In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP managed one seat but failed to retain it in 2019 but increased its vote share to 3. 6%. ",

The film follows the efforts in Ireland to turn a seemingly useless racing horse into a Derby-winner.\", \"The March Hare is Atlantic Canada's largest poetry festival. It started in 1987 or 1988 as an unpretentious evening of poetry and entertainment at the Blomidon Golf and Country Club in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, designed to appeal to a general audience. The Hare takes place in early March each year. Loosely associated with the Sir Wilfred Grenfell College campus of Memorial University through the leadership of poet-organizer Al Pittman and the involvement of other writers who taught at the College, the Hare was equally the brain-child of teacher Rex Brown and club manager George Daniels.

    "evidence": "The Tobacco Regulation Act only requires text health warnings, despite the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control treaty which was adopted in May 2003 and of which the Philippines is a signatory. In 2010, the Department of Health issued an administrative order requiring the inclusion of graphic warning labels on packs and prohibiting the use of misleading descriptors such as \"mild\" and \"light\" on tobacco product packaging and labels pursuant to Article 11 of the WHO FCTC. In response, the tobacco companies filed five cases against the Department of Health questioning its authority. In June 2014, a legislative committee composed of senators and congressmen passed a bill, called \"The Graphic Health Warnings Law\", compelling cigarette manufacturers to print pictures and illustrations that warn about the dangers of smoking on cigarette packs. The images would occupy the lower half of the front and rear panels of a cigarette pack and could include pictures of cancerous lungs and throats.Some countries also impose legal requirements on the packaging of tobacco products. For example, in the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Australia and South Africa, cigarette packs must be prominently labeled with the health risks associated with smoking. Canada, Australia, Thailand, Iceland and Brazil have also imposed labels upon cigarette packs warning smokers of the effects, and they include graphic images of the potential health effects of smoking. Cards are also inserted into cigarette packs in Canada. There are sixteen of them, and only one comes in a pack. They explain different methods of quitting smoking. Also, in the United Kingdom, there have been a number of graphic NHS advertisements, one showing a cigarette filled with fatty deposits, as if the cigarette is symbolizing the artery of a smoker.",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "All passengers have passed health screenings during a layover in Alaska. Plane evacuates US citizens from ChinaThe U. S.  government's chartered flight evacuating American consulate staffers and private U. S.  citizens from the coronavirus epicenter of Wuhan, China, has been rerouted from its original California destination to a nearby military base. The flight, with more than 200 people aboard, is now scheduled to arrive at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, about 30 miles from where the flight was originally scheduled to land, in Ontario, California, just outside of Los Angeles. Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the announcement Tuesday night Pacific time after informing California officials about the change. The plane touched down in Anchorage, Alaska, at around 9:30 p. m.  local time to be refueled before heading on to California for an expected Wednesday morning arrival. \"A big cheer let out on the plane when we landed,\" passenger Patrick Stockstill said after arriving in Anchorage. \"I'm tired and exhausted mentally and physically,\" said the Rhode Island resident, \"but happy to be back and just really grateful the United States government came through for us. \"The plane's 201 passengers underwent two sets of health screenings upon arrival in Anchorage, and all were approved to continue on to California, officials said in a press briefing early Wednesday morning. Passengers erupted into cheers once they were all cleared, officials said.  Authorities had said earlier that anyone who got sick en route to Alaska could be separated from the group in Anchorage and flown onward independently. All passengers were also screened twice before leaving China, said officials. Upon arrival in California, all passengers will be quarantined for at least three days and monitored by the CDC, per authorities.  Those who show signs of the illness and need to be tested could be held for as many as 14 days. While around 4,500 people have been sickened in China, the CDC said on Monday that the disease is \"not spreading\" in the U. S.  There have been five confirmed cases so far -- all of whom traveled to Wuhan. The U. S.  consulate general evacuated the majority of its staff and has urged U. S.  citizens not to travel to Hubei province, all but closing its doors amid the outbreak that has rattled nerves around the world. Seats on the charter flight were open to American citizens, with an alert sent Sunday notifying those in China and registered with the U. S.  mission.  American citizens were required to pay for their seat, and capacity was limited, with priority given to those most at risk of infection, per the spokesperson. The majority of the 200 seats on board the flight went to private citizens, with less than a quarter needed for U. S.  personnel and their families. The initial notice that went out Sunday said the flight would travel to San Francisco, but the director of San Francisco International Airport and the State Department said Monday that was no longer true. Trucks carrying drinking water, portable showers, and water storage tanks were seen arriving Tuesday at Ontario International, a small airport in San Bernardino County that serves as an official U. S.  government repatriation center for the West Coast. \"Ontario International Airport (ONT) is working closely with our federal, state, county and city partners to plan for the possibility of a flight carrying U. S.  government officials and private citizens returning this week from Wuhan, China,\" Ontario International Airport said in a statement Monday, before the plane's flight plan was changed.  Airport officials said they had \"conducted extensive training in managing situations such as this.  In the event that the returning passengers do arrive at ONT, preparations are being made to ensure that proper health, safety and security procedures are followed. \"The State Department raised its travel advisory for China on Monday, urging American citizens to \"reconsider travel\" to the whole country.  There has been a \"do not travel\" warning in place since Thursday for Hubei province when the consulate general announced it was pulling out all nonemergency personnel. The CDC raised its travel warning on Tuesday to match the State Department's, urging all travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to China. At least 106 people have died from the illness in China, mostly in Wuhan.

Mueller\u2019s letter showed the former FBI director felt Barr\u2019s letter to Congress didn\u2019t fully capture his 448-page report.  \n  \n    \u201cYou know, the letter\u2019s a bit snitty, and I think it was probably written by one of his staff people,\u201d Barr said.   \n  \n    A spokesman for the special counsel, Peter Carr, declined to comment to CNN when asked about Barr\u2019s characterization.  \n  \n    The Washington Post first reported Mueller\u2019s letter to Barr.  CNN later obtained the full letter. \n  \n    The Wednesday hearing was the first time Barr made an appearance before Congress since the release of a redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report last month.  \n  \n    In the hearing, Democrats clashed with the attorney general over his handling of the Mueller findings and his decision not to prosecute for obstruction of justice.

Lavrov (seen shaking President Trump\u2019s hand) and Sergey Kislyak. The woman circled in red in this photograph, however, is not Mariia Butina. Mariia Butina was not mentioned in any contemporaneous news reports of the meeting. Although Butina bears passing resemblance to the woman in the photograph (see comparison below), a National Security Council (NSC) source told Buzzfeed that the pictured woman was actually an NSC staffer:  Zeke Miller, a White House reporter with the Associated Press, also confirmed that the pictured woman was not Butina:  The NSC staffer has not been identified by name but is possibly Cari Lutkins:  Mariia Butina has been photographed in the company of various American politicians and NRA officials, but there\u2019s no evidence that she was present at this Oval Office meeting in March 2017. The claim that she was appears to be based on little more than her bearing a slight resemblance to a red-haired U.S. government employee.

    "evidence": "`` Little Boy '' was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay , piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr. , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces . It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare . The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test , and the first uranium-based detonation . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 ktonTNT . The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima and its occupants .   Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group of Captain William S. Parsons 's Ordnance -LRB- O -RRB- Division at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II . Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer . The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun-type fission weapon , but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235 . This was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium -LRB- the `` bullet '' -RRB- onto a solid cylinder of the same material -LRB- the `` target '' -RRB- by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg of enriched uranium , of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design .   After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed , but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base . The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft -LRB- which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers -RRB- . All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951 . ",

    "evidence": "Romeo Void's best known song is \"Never Say Never\", which contains the famous line \"I might like you better if we slept together.\" Allmusic writer Heather Phares has argued that Iyall's \"teasing, existential musings [...] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid-'90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair\". Phares concluded that the song was \"a subversive, influential classic\" and \"one of new wave's most distinctive and innovative moments. \" The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank. The song \"A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)\", their highest-charting single, was reportedly written as a response to Michael Jackson's hit song \"Billie Jean\", but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation (\"Undercover Kept\") and generation gaps (\"Chinatown\").Susan suffers from boredom while Jackson is away, and witnesses an argument between Lee and Bob. Susan asks Lee if she can go clubbing with him for the night, and they go out together. While at the club, Susan receives a call from Jackson who tells her he's been offered a job away from Fairview, and he asks her to move with him. She and Lee talk about it at the club and Susan decides she's going to move. The next morning, however, she wakes up with Lee in bed next to her and assumes that they've slept together when she goes downstairs to see a Jazz CD in the player and two empty bottles of wine on the table. Susan asks Gaby for advice without telling her who it was, believing she purposely slept with Lee to sabotage her relationship with Jackson. When Bob comes over to ask if Lee stayed the night, Gaby puts two and two together. Later on, Susan directly asks Lee if they slept together, to find to her relief that they didn't. Lee advises Susan that she shouldn't move away with Jackson until she is in love with him and she is sure that is what she wants.",

    "evidence": "The National Security Agency -LRB- NSA -RRB- is a military intelligence organization and a constituent of the United States Department of Defense -LRB- DOD -RRB- . The NSA is responsible for global monitoring , collection , and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes , a discipline known as signals intelligence -LRB- SIGINT -RRB- . NSA is concurrently charged with protection of U.S. government communications and information systems against penetration and network warfare . Although many of NSA 's programs rely on `` passive '' electronic collection , the agency is authorized to accomplish its mission through active clandestine means , among which are physically bugging electronic systems and allegedly engaging in sabotage through subversive software . Moreover , NSA maintains physical presence in a large number of countries across the globe , where its Special Collection Service -LRB- SCS -RRB- inserts eavesdropping devices in difficult-to-reach places . SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass `` close surveillance , burglary , wiretapping , breaking and entering . ''   Unlike the Defense Intelligence Agency -LRB- DIA -RRB- and the Central Intelligence Agency -LRB- CIA -RRB- , both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage , NSA does not unilaterally conduct human-source intelligence gathering , despite often being portrayed so in popular culture . Instead , NSA is entrusted with assistance to and coordination of SIGINT elements at other government organizations , which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities without the approval of the NSA via the Defense Secretary . As part of these streamlining responsibilities , the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service -LRB- CSS -RRB- , which was created to facilitate cooperation between NSA and other U.S. military cryptanalysis components . Additionally , the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service .   Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II , it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 . Since then , it has become one of the largest U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget , operating as part of the Department of Defense and simultaneously reporting to the Director of National Intelligence .   NSA surveillance has been a matter of political controversy on several occasions , such as its spying on anti-Vietnam-war leaders and economic espionage . In 2013 , the extent of some of the NSA 's secret surveillance programs was revealed to the public by Edward Snowden . According to the leaked documents , the NSA intercepts the communications of over a billion people worldwide , many of whom are United States citizens , and tracks the movement of hundreds of millions of people using cellphones . Internationally , research has pointed to the NSA 's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through `` boomerang routing '' . ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "\"I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,\" Tony Evers wrote. Trump weighs in on weekend of unrest, set to visit WisconsinWisconsin Gov.  Tony Evers \"respectfully\" asked that President Donald Trump reconsider visiting Kenosha this week amid civil unrest over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, saying he was concerned his presence would \"only hinder our healing. \"White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere told reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday that Trump planned to travel to the city on Tuesday to meet with law enforcement and survey damage from destructive protests, according to pool reports. In response, the Democratic governor penned a letter Sunday urging the president to call off the trip. \"I, along with other community leaders who have reached out, are concerned about what your presence will mean for Kenosha and our state,\" Evers wrote.  \"I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing.  I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together. \"Protests have occurred nightly in Kenosha, some 40 miles south of Milwaukee, over the police shooting of Blake, a 29-year-old Black man.  The Aug.  23 incident, which was captured on cellphone video, has left Blake paralyzed. On Tuesday, protests turned deadly, when an alleged 17-year-old gunman shot three protesters, killing two of them. Hundreds of members of the National Guard have been deployed to Kenosha amid the civil unrest, and a state-of-emergency curfew has been extended through Tuesday. In his letter, Evers expressed concern that a visit from the president would redirect resources from the city's recovery \"at a time when it is critical that we continue to remain focused on keeping the people of Kenosha safe and supporting the community's response. \"The letter comes as Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called for Trump to \"support us, or stay the hell out of the way,\" following a deadly shooting during protests in the Oregon city. Jacob Blake's uncle, Justin Blake, told ABC News he thinks Trump is partially responsible for what happened to his nephew and for the violence across the country. \"How could they not be feeding on violence when the man in the White House is steadily drumming it up? \" he said. When asked about Trump's planned visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, Justin Blake said that his family has not heard from the president, but they don't want \"anything to do with him. \"\"We believe he incited this violence,\" he said. In his acceptance speech during the Republican National Convention last week, Trump painted the election as an existential choice between lawlessness and law and order, and listed Kenosha as one of the \"Democrat-run cities\" suffering from \"rioting, looting, arson and violence. \"His challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, charged Sunday that the president is \"recklessly encouraging violence\" and \"fanning the flames of hate and division in our society. \"In his letter, Evers noted that on Monday, the Wisconsin legislature will take up a policing accountability and transparency reform package.  \"I would welcome your support of these initiatives,\" he wrote to Trump.

He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League 's -LRB- CFL -RRB- Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football .   Anoa\u02bbi then pursued a career in professional wrestling and was signed by WWE in 2010 , reporting to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling -LRB- FCW -RRB- .

Reigns has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-view events , including the last three WrestleManias -LRB- 31 , 32 and 33 -RRB- -- scoring wins over Triple H and The Undertaker .

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "There is a moderate risk of flash floods in many parts of Uttarakhand, including Bageshwar, Rudraprayag and Chamoli districts, as monsoon strengthens over northwest India, according to Central Water Commission\u2019s (CWC) flood warning. Eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP) has recorded extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), on Tuesday along with very heavy rains reported over Uttarakhand, Haryana, eastern Madhya Pradesh (MP), eastern Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat, but only very light rain over Delhi. Delhi has a 35% of rain deficiency to date. \u201cMost parts of north-west India have started recorded very heavy rains, except for Delhi, since Sunday (August 9). But the region is getting moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is to the north of its normal position (from Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal). So, rains are expected during the next two-three days. A low-pressure area is also developing over the north-west Bay of Bengal, which will bring good rains to central India and extremely heavy rains to Gujarat,\u201d said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC). When a low-pressure area had developed over the Bay of Bengal, the Konkan region had recorded severe rains, but this time Gujarat will record the impact of the low-pressure area, which is likely to develop on Thursday, Sathi Devi said. A north-south trough runs from Bihar to the west-central Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels. A cyclonic circulation lies over the north-west and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal off the Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its bulletin on Wednesday. Under the influence of the two systems, a low-pressure area is likely to form over the north-west Bay of Bengal by Thursday. It is likely to persist over the region and become more organised over the north Bay of Bengal during the next two-three days. The western part of the monsoon trough has shifted to the north of its normal position and it is likely to remain there during the next 48 hours. The eastern part of it is in its near-normal position. Due to these favourable conditions widespread and very heavy rain is likely over major parts of northwest India (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, UP) during the next two-three days. Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Gujarat and eastern Rajasthan and heavy to very heavy rain over northern parts of Konkan and Goa between Thursday and Saturday (August 13 to 15). As on Tuesday, 20 Stations (13 in Bihar, three in Uttar Pradesh, two in Assam and one each in Jharkhand and West Bengal) are flowing in a severe flood situation and 36 stations (13 in Bihar, 10 in Assam, five in Uttar Pradesh, three in Kerala, two in Uttarakhand and one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal) are flowing above normal flood situation. Severe flood is declared, when the water level is touching or exceeding the danger level but below the highest flood level (HFL). Monsoon rain until Wednesday over the country had 0% deficiency. But there is 22% and 2% rain deficiency over northwest India and central India, respectively; and 23% and 8% excess rainfall over the southern peninsula and eastern and north-east India, respectively.

    "claim": "the term territorial state means a state has supreme and absolute authority within its own borders.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty. This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty. An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch. They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority. An example of an internal sovereign or monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century; Louis XIV claimed that he was the state. Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty. Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will. This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind. The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.The All-powerful Creators were discovered to be a cabal of military leaders and politicians. Contrary to propaganda, very few of the originators of the coup that overthrew the Imperial government are still part of the Creators. Most were replaced by newer recruits. Some advanced through the ranks, while others came from the opposition. All Creators went by pseudonyms which reflected either their personality traits or their level of power relative to the head Creator (who, naturally, called himself \"Papa\"). All Creators had absolute authority within their areas of government. Often, those areas overlapped, which led to bloody skirmishes. Papa, however, commanded the ultimate authority within the Unknown Fathers, executing any Father that displeased him.",

    "evidence": "The United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation and to create and maintain international order . A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations , the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; there are now 193 . The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan , New York City , and experiences extraterritoriality . Further main offices are situated in Geneva , Nairobi , and Vienna . The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states . Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security , promoting human rights , fostering social and economic development , protecting the environment , and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine , natural disaster , and armed conflict . The UN is the largest , most familiar , most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organisation in the world .   The UN Charter was drafted at a conference between April -- June 1945 in San Francisco , and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference ; this charter took effect 24 October 1945 , and the UN began operation . The UN 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies . The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo , as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 . The organization 's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s , and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping . After the end of the Cold War , the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success .   The UN has six principal organs : the General Assembly -LRB- the main deliberative assembly -RRB- ; the Security Council -LRB- for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security -RRB- ; the Economic and Social Council -LRB- ECOSOC ; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development -RRB- ; the Secretariat -LRB- for providing studies , information , and facilities needed by the UN -RRB- ; the International Court of Justice -LRB- the primary judicial organ -RRB- ; and the UN Trusteeship Council -LRB- inactive since 1994 -RRB- . UN System agencies include the World Bank Group , the World Health Organization , the World Food Programme , UNESCO , and UNICEF . The UN 's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General , an office held by Portuguese Ant\u00f3nio Guterres since 2017 . Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN 's work .   The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 , and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize . Other evaluations of the UN 's effectiveness have been mixed . Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development , while others have called the organization ineffective , corrupt , or biased . ",

It was written and produced by , and features Scottish DJ Calvin Harris ; the song was also featured on his third album 18 Months -LRB- 2012 -RRB- . `` We Found Love '' premiered on September 22 , 2011 , on the Capital FM radio station in the United Kingdom , and was made available to download on the same day as the lead single from Talk That Talk . `` We Found Love '' is an uptempo electro house song , with elements of techno and Europop . The song 's lyrics speak of a couple who `` found love in a hopeless place '' .   `` We Found Love '' was met with mixed reviews from music critics , who praised the song 's composition and Rihanna 's vocal performance ; however , some critics felt that the lyrical content was sparse and came second to Harris ' production . The song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for ten non-consecutive weeks , becoming the longest running number-one single of 2011 . The single also surpassed `` Umbrella '' and became Rihanna 's longest running number one single . It was the singer 's eleventh song to top the Hot 100 , placing her in third place among female recording artists amassing the most number one singles . `` We Found Love '' topped the charts in twenty-five other countries including Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . According to Billboard it is the 24th most successful single of all time in the US . As of 2015 , the single has sold 10.5 million copies worldwide , thus being one of the best selling singles of all time . This was the first of multiple collaborations by Rihanna and Harris , including `` Where Have You Been '' and `` This Is What You Came For '' .   The song 's accompanying music video , directed by Melina Matsoukas , depicts the singer as a drug-abusing thrill-seeker in a relationship that quickly spirals downward into addiction and violence . The video received a mixed response from critics , as they noted that it profoundly alludes to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown 's assault on Rihanna , two years prior . It attracted criticism from political commentators , who questioned the video for its suggestive sexual nature . However , the video won a Grammy for `` Best Short Form Music Video '' at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards and `` Video of the Year '' at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards . The song has been performed on both the UK and US versions of The X Factor , as well as at the 2012 Grammy Awards and the 2012 BRIT Awards . Multiple recording artists have covered `` We Found Love '' including alternative rock band Coldplay and English singer Jessie J . The song also used for the trailer of 2012 comedy-drama film Magic Mike , in the TV series Sherlock , and in the film American Honey ",

Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle and tries to kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song \"Oh, Fionna\" and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Lewinski , known as Erich von Manstein -LRB- 24 November 1887 -- 9 June 1973 -RRB- , was a German commander of the Wehrmacht , Nazi Germany 's armed forces during the Second World War . He attained the rank of field marshal .   Born into an aristocratic Prussian family with a long history of military service , Manstein joined the army at a young age and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War -LRB- 1914 -- 18 -RRB- . He rose to the rank of captain by the end of the war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces . In September 1939 , during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War , he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt 's Army Group South . Adolf Hitler chose Manstein 's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940 , a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH . Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands , Manstein devised an innovative operation -- later known as the Sichelschnitt -LRB- `` sickle cut '' -RRB- -- that called for an attack through the woods of the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel , thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders . Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign , he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol -LRB- 1941 -- 1942 -RRB- , and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942 . He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad .   Germany 's fortunes in the war began to take an unfavourable turn later in 1942 , especially in the catastrophic Battle of Stalingrad , where Manstein commanded a failed relief effort -LRB- `` Operation Winter Storm '' -RRB- in December . Later known as the `` backhand blow '' , Manstein 's counteroffensive in the Third Battle of Kharkov -LRB- February -- March 1943 -RRB- regained substantial territory and resulted in the destruction of three Soviet armies and the retreat of three others . He was one of the primary commanders at the Battle of Kursk -LRB- July -- August 1943 -RRB- , one of the largest tank battles in history . His ongoing disagreements with Hitler over the conduct of the war led to his dismissal in March 1944 . He never obtained another command and was taken prisoner by the British in August 1945 , several months after Germany 's defeat .   Manstein gave testimony at the main Nuremberg trials of war criminals in August 1946 , and prepared a paper that , along with his later memoirs , helped cultivate the myth of a `` clean Wehrmacht '' -- the myth that the German armed forces were not culpable for the atrocities of the Holocaust . In 1949 he was tried in Hamburg for war crimes and was convicted on nine of seventeen counts , including the poor treatment of prisoners of war and failing to protect civilian lives in his sphere of operations . His sentence of eighteen years in prison was later reduced to twelve , and he served only four years before being released in 1953 . As a military advisor to the West German government in the mid-1950s , he helped re-establish the armed forces . His memoir , Verlorene Siege -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , translated into English as Lost Victories , was highly critical of Hitler 's leadership , and only dealt with the military aspects of the war , ignoring its political and ethical contexts . Manstein died in Munich in 1973 . ",

For starters, the Nazi salute is delivered by raising \u201can outstretched right arm with the palm down,\u201d according to the Anti-Defamation League. That isn\u2019t the pose struck here by Harris, who is raising her left arm, not her right. Harris\u2019 gesture is more akin to the celebratory pose struck by her teammate Rapinoe after one of her many World Cup tournament goals: More importantly, this photograph appears to have originated from the social media pages of the pictured museum. On July 10, 2019, approximately two days before the \u201cNazi salute\u201d claim was attached to this image, the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan posted the photograph along with a message stating how happy the museum was to be a part of the team\u2019s World Cup victory celebration:  Harris was not giving a Nazi salute or being disrespectful in front of the Holocaust museum.

He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership .   Born and raised in Liverpool , Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager ; his first band , the Quarrymen , first became the Silver Beatles , and finally , evolved into the Beatles in 1960 . When the group disbanded in 1970 , Lennon embarked on a sporadic solo career that produced albums including John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine , and songs such as `` Give Peace a Chance '' , `` Working Class Hero '' , and `` Imagine '' . After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969 , he added `` Ono '' as one of his middle names . Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean , but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy . He was murdered three weeks after its release .   Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music , writing , drawings , on film and in interviews . Controversial through his political and peace activism , he moved to Manhattan in 1971 , where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon 's administration to deport him , while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture .   By 2012 , Lennon 's solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and , as writer , co-writer , or performer , he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart . In 2002 , a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and , in 2008 , Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time . He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 , and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice , in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and in 1994 as a solo artist . ",

    "evidence": "Aristotle -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8\u00e6r\u026a\u02ccst\u0252t\u0259l -RSB- \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 , -LSB- aristot\u00e9l\u025b\u02d0s -RSB- , Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s ; 384 -- 322 BC -RRB- was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira , Chalkidice , on the northern periphery of Classical Greece . His father , Nicomachus , died when Aristotle was a child , whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian . At seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato 's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven -LRB- c. 347 BC -RRB- . His writings cover many subjects -- including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theater , music , rhetoric , linguistics , politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy . Shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Macedon , tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .   Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies . He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books . The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism , but , following Plato 's death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism . He believed all peoples ' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception . Aristotle 's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .   Aristotle 's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . Some of Aristotle 's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl -LRB- reproductive -RRB- arm of the octopus , were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century . His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic .   In metaphysics , Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology , especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Roman Catholic Church . Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as `` The First Teacher '' -LRB- -LSB- -RRB- .   His ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . All aspects of Aristotle 's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today . Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as `` a river of gold '' -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived . , Plato -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8ple\u026ato\u028a -RSB- Greek : \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd Pl\u00e1t\u014dn , -LSB- pl\u00e1.t\u0254\u02d0n -RSB- in Classical Attic ; 428/427 or 424/423 -- 348/347 BCE -RRB- was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens , the first institution of higher learning in the Western world . He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy , especially the Western tradition . Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries , Plato 's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years .   Along with his teacher , Socrates , and his most famous student , Aristotle , Plato laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science . Alfred North Whitehead once noted : `` the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato . '' In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science , philosophy , and mathematics , Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality . Plato 's influence on Christianity is often thought to be mediated by his major influence on Saint Augustine of Hippo , one of the most important philosophers and theologians in the foundation of the Western thought . In the 19th century the philosopher Nietzsche criticized Christianity by saying it 's `` Platonism for the people '' . Numenius of Apamea viewed this differently , he called Plato the Hellenic Moses . This would justify the superiority of Christianity over Hellenism because Moses predates Plato - thus the original source of this wisdom is the root of Christianity and not Hellenistic culture .   Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy . Plato appears to have been the founder of Western political philosophy , with his Republic , and Laws among other dialogues , providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political questions from a philosophical perspective . Plato 's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates , Parmenides , Heraclitus and Pythagoras , although few of his predecessors ' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures today derives from Plato himself .   The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes Plato as '' ... one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating , wide-ranging , and influential authors in the history of philosophy . ... He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word `` philosopher '' should be applied . But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived , and what its scope and ambitions properly are , and he so transformed the intellectual currents with which he grappled , that the subject of philosophy , as it is often conceived -- a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical , political , metaphysical , and epistemological issues , armed with a distinctive method -- can be called his invention . Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate him in depth and range : perhaps only Aristotle -LRB- who studied with him -RRB- , Aquinas and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank .

Pearce stars as a man who , as a result of a past trauma , suffers from anterograde amnesia , the inability to form new memories and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes . He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife , using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he can not remember . Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film : a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically , and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order -LRB- simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist -RRB- . The two sequences `` meet '' at the end of the film , producing one complete and cohesive narrative .   Memento premiered on September 5 , 2000 , at the Venice International Film Festival and was released in European theaters starting in October . It became a blockbuster success , being acclaimed by critics who praised its nonlinear narrative structure and motifs of memory , perception , grief , and self-deception , and earning $ 39.7 million over a $ 9 million budget .

In the programme , `` the Doctor '' is the alias assumed by a centuries-old alien -- a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey -- who travels through space and time in his TARDIS , frequently with companions .   Since the show 's inception in 1963 , the character has been portrayed by twelve lead actors . The transition to each succeeding actor is explained within the show 's narrative through the plot device of `` regeneration '' , a biological function of his race that allows their change of cellular structure and appearance with recovery following a potentially fatal injury . The incumbent Doctor is the Twelfth Doctor , played by Peter Capaldi , who succeeded Matt Smith in the role in the 2013 Christmas special `` The Time of the Doctor '' after he was granted a new `` cycle '' of regenerations by the Time Lords . The War Doctor and an aborted regeneration are counted in his previous cycle of twelve regenerations . A number of other actors have played the character in stage and audio plays , as well as in various film and television productions . The character has been generally well received by the public , with his enduring popularity leading The Daily Telegraph to dub him `` Britain 's favourite alien '' . On 30 January 2017 , Capaldi confirmed that the tenth series would be his last . ",

His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War . His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal , and he was brother-in-la   Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the Mediterranean Basin , when the Roman Republic established its supremacy over other great powers such as ancient Carthage and the Greek kingdoms of Macedonia , Syracuse , and the Seleucid Empire . One of his most famous achievements was at the outbreak of the Second Punic War , when he marched an army which included war elephants from Iberia over the Pyrenees and the Alps into Italy . In his first few years in Italy , he won three dramatic victories -- the Trebia , Lake Trasimene , and Cannae , in which he distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent 's strengths and weaknesses , and to play the battle to his strengths and the enemy 's weaknesses -- and won over many allies of Rome . Hannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years but was unable to march on Rome . An enemy counter-invasion of North Africa forced him to return to Carthage , where he was decisively defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama . Scipio had studied Hannibal 's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own , and finally defeated Rome 's nemesis at Zama , having previously driven Hannibal 's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula .   After the war , Hannibal successfully ran for the office of sufet . He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome ; however , Hannibal 's reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome , and he fled into voluntary exile . During this time , he lived at the Seleucid court , where he acted as military advisor to Antiochus III the Great in his war against Rome . Antiochus met defeat at the Battle of Magnesia and was forced to accept Rome 's terms , and Hannibal fled again , making a stop in the Kingdom of Armenia . His flight ended in the court of Bithynia , where he achieved an outstanding naval victory against a fleet from Pergamon . He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself .   Hannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity , together with Philip of Macedon , Alexander the Great , Julius Caesar , and Scipio Africanus . Plutarch states that Hannibal was questioned by Scipio as to who was the greatest general , and Hannibal replied either Alexander or Pyrrhus , then himself , or , according to another version of the event , Pyrrhus , Scipio , then himself . Military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge called Hannibal the `` father of strategy '' , because his greatest enemy , Rome , came to adopt elements of his military tactics in its own strategic arsenal . This praise has earned him a strong reputation in the modern world , and he was regarded as a great strategist by Napoleon and others . ",

Gabby Giffords, while rallying a group of roughly 20 gun violence survivors and gun control advocates before they head to the Hill to meet with lawmakers Tuesday, gave an upbeat view on the future of gun control bills in a Democratic controlled Congress as well as of her own health, years after she was shot in Tucson, Arizona. \n  \n    Giffords traveled to Washington, on Tuesday, the eighth anniversary of the shooting that left six dead and almost killed her, to help introduce a bill requiring background checks on private transaction gun sales. \n  \n    \u201cThank you for inviting me here today.  It has been a long hard haul, but I am getting better,\u201d Giffords said.  \u201cI am working hard at lots of things: speech therapy, physical therapy and yoga, too. \u201d\n  \nFormer Congresswoman Gabby Giffords to help introduce gun background check legislation\n\n    She added: \u201cMy spirit is strong as ever and I am still fighting to make the world a better place and you can too.  Get involved with your community, be a leader, set an example, be passionate, be courageous. \u201d\n  \n    Giffords has become one of the nation\u2019s pre-eminent gun control advocates since the 2011 shooting.  On Tuesday she will join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep.  Mike Thompson, a California Democrat, to unveil the background check bill. \n\n    Democrats introduced a similar bill in 2018, but the measure was not taken up by Republicans, who were then in control of the House. \n  \n    Giffords and her team of aides and advisers working to pass background check and other gun legislation sounded optimistic about what a Democratic-led House could achieve. \n  \n    \u201cFor so many years we have not had any action in Congress,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, the director of government affairs at Giffords\u2019 eponymous organization.  \u201cWhat we saw this past November \u2026 really signified a shift that voters are very clear with us and they want to see something happen. \u201d\n  \n    Lloyd said Tuesday\u2019s bill will \u201cprovide a background check on every gun sale, no matter where it happens. \u201d\n  \n    \u201cEvery single firearm sale under this bill will have to have a background check,\u201d Lloyd said.  She later noted that there is an exemption for a family gift. \n  \n    Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords\u2019 group, echoed Lloyd, arguing the group believes gun control advocates will notch more victories this year because they now have \u201callies with gavels,\u201d a nod to the fact Democrats will now be the chairs of House committees. \n  \n    Giffords engaged throughout the conversation with survivors.  When one woman mentioned that it doesn\u2019t take much to background check someone looking to buy a gun, Giffords exclaimed, \u201cFive minutes \u2026 five minutes. \u201d\n  \n    She closed the event by urging everyone to \u201cfight, fight, fight. \u201d\n  \nPro-gun group challenges Trump administration move banning bump stocks\n\n    The group of gun violence survivors included Marc Orfanos, the father of Telemachus Orfanos who was killed in Thousand Oaks, California, in November; Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was killed in Aurora, Colorado in 2012 and Ashley Baez, who was shot in the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last February. \n\n    Although the mood in the room was upbeat, Lloyd and others acknowledged that the road in the Senate is uphill. \n  \n    \u201cAt this moment the Senate bill will not be bipartisan,\u201d she said. \n  \n    The men and women at this event will meet with other lawmakers on Capitol Hill later Tuesday.  Survivors of the shooting that left Giffords seriously wounded said they will meet with Arizona\u2019s senators, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally. \n  \n    \u201cWe are looking at this as a new opportunity to engage with her and discuss how important this is to those of us in Arizona,\u201d Pat Maisch, a survivor of the Tucson shooting, said in reference to McSally.  \u201cShe is new, and we are not going to let up on her. \u201d\n  \n    Maisch wrestled a gun magazine out of the shooter\u2019s hand in 2011. \n  \n    Sandy Phillips said they are going to Capitol Hill to let lawmakers \u201cknow that times are changing, there are more and more survivors every day and that the American public is fed up with gun violence. \u201d\n  \n    \u201cI think they realize now,\u201d Phillips added, \u201cthat we aren\u2019t going away. \u201d\n  \nCNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report. \n\u00a9 2021 Cable News Network.

    "evidence": "2001 : A Space Odyssey is a 1968 epic science-fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick . The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke , partially inspired by Clarke 's short story `` The Sentinel '' . Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001 : A Space Odyssey , published soon after the film was released . The film follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer Hal after the discovery of a mysterious black monolith affecting human evolution . It deals with the themes of existentialism , human evolution , technology , artificial intelligence , and extraterrestrial life . It is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight , pioneering special effects , and ambiguous imagery . It uses sound and minimal dialogue in place of traditional narrative techniques ; the soundtrack consists of classical music such as Gayane Ballet Suite , The Blue Danube , Also sprach Zarathustra , and pieces from contemporary composer Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti .   2001 : A Space Odyssey was financed and distributed by American studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , but it was filmed and edited almost entirely in England using the studio facilities of the MGM-British Studios and those of Shepperton Studios , mostly because of the availability of much larger sound stages than in the United States . Production was subcontracted to Kubrick 's production company , and care was taken that the film would be sufficiently British to qualify for subsidy from the Eady Levy . Kubrick had shot his previous two films in England and decided to settle there permanently during filming .   2001 : A Space Odyssey initially received mixed reactions from critics and audiences , but it garnered a cult following and slowly became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968 . It was nominated for four Academy Awards and received one for its visual effects . The sequel 2010 was released in 1984 , directed by Peter Hyams .   Today , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made . In 1991 , it was deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry . The critics ' polls in the 2002 and 2012 editions of Sight & Sound magazine ranked 2001 : A Space Odyssey sixth in the top ten films of all time ; it also tied for second place in the directors ' poll of the same magazine . In 2010 , it was named the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal . ",

New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother , the Duke of York . New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790 . It has been the country 's largest city since 1790 .

The state has a maritime border in the Atlantic Ocean with Rhode Island , east of Long Island , as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the northwest . The state of New York , with an estimated 19.8 million residents in 2015 , is also referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City , the state 's most populous city and its economic hub .   With an estimated population of 8.55 million in 2015 , New York City is the most populous city in the United States and the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States . The New York Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world .

New York City makes up over 40 % of the population of New York State . Two-thirds of the state 's population lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area , and nearly 40 % lives on Long Island . Both the state and New York City were named for the 17th-century Duke of York , future King James II of England . The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo , Rochester , Yonkers , and Syracuse , while the state capital is Albany .   New York has a diverse geography . The southern part of the state consists of Long Island and several smaller associated islands , as well as New York City and the lower Hudson River Valley , most of which lie within the wider Atlantic Coastal Plain . The large region known as Upstate New York consists of several ranges of the wider Appalachian Mountains , including the Allegheny Plateau and Catskills along New York 's Southern Tier , and the Adirondack Mountains , Thousand Islands archipelago , and Saint Lawrence Seaway in the Northeastern lobe of the state . These more mountainous regions are bisected by two major river valleys -- the north-south Hudson River Valley and the east-west Mohawk River Valley , which forms the core of the Erie Canal . Western New York is considered part of the Great Lakes Region and straddles Lake Ontario and Lake Erie . Between the two lakes lies Niagara Falls . The central part of the state is dominated by the Finger Lakes , a popular vacation and tourist destination .   New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York . The first Europeans to arrive were French colonists and Jesuit missionaries who arrived southward from settlements at Montreal for trade and proselytizing . In 1609 , the region was claimed by Henry Hudson for the Dutch , who built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers , where the present-day capital of Albany later developed . The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley , establishing the colony of New Netherland , a multicultural community from its earliest days and a center of trade and immigration . The British annexed the colony from the Dutch in 1664 . The borders of the British colony , the Province of New York , were similar to those of the present-day state .   Many landmarks in New York are well known to both international and domestic visitors , with New York State hosting four of the world 's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013 : Times Square , Central Park , Niagara Falls -LRB- shared with Ontario -RRB- , and Grand Central Terminal .

    "evidence": "In early September 2018, an image purportedly showing the Nike \u201cswoosh\u201d symbol on the tag of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat started spreading online:  The image was posted in the midst of a controversy over former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s involvement\u00a0in a new advertising campaign for Nike, a sports apparel company. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 by kneeling during pregame renditions of the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality. The \u201ctake a knee\u201d protests, which caught on with other NFL players and spread to athletes in other sports, were viewed by some (including President Trump) as unpatriotic and disrespectful to veterans. So when Kaepernick showed up in Nike\u2019s 0th anniversary \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad campaign, some disgruntled consumers took to social media to share photographs and videos of themselves destroying various pieces of Nike apparel to demonstrate their displeasure. It appears that this image of a Nike-branded \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap was posted in an attempt to \u201ctroll\u201d pro-Trump conservatives who were upset over Kaepernick\u2019s endorsement deal (\u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d or \u201cMAGA,\u201d is a well-known Trump slogan). When the image was shared by Twitter user @Nicoxw1, for example, it included a message facetiously noting that \u201c133,291,000 Americans will have a stroke today.\u201d The image is a hoax, merely a manipulated version of an older viral image showing a \u201cMade in China\u201d tag on a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. Here\u2019s a look at the original photograph, as well as a side-by-side comparison of the Nike MAGA hat image (right) and the original \u201cMade in China\u201d image (left):  It should be noted that while some third-party companies do produce \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats in China, the website DonaldJTrump.com, from which customers can purchase official MAGA merchandise, states that all their products are \u201cproudly made in U.S.A.\u201d Sandritter, Mark. \u00a0 \u201cA Timeline of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s National Anthem Protest and the Athletes Who Joined Him.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 SB Nation. \u00a0 25 September 2017.",

    "evidence": "Under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the Central Secretariat with enlarged functions stood along as the sole organ to lead the civil administration in the Yuan realm, as the Yuan founder Kublai Khan wanted a centralized executive agency that took charge of all civil governing affairs throughout the empire. Models for it had long been part of Chinese imperial government, but now it was to function in a new context. The Central Secretariat also directly governed a large territory surrounding the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) known as the Central Region (\u8179\u88cf, \"fuli\"), including the present-day Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, the south-eastern part of present-day Inner Mongolia and the Henan areas to the north of the Yellow River (initially also the Mongolian steppe). Branch Secretariats (\u884c\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701) were set up throughout the empire and were subordinated to the Central Secretariat. Branch Secretariats gradually became provincial-level administrative organizations or institutions known simply as the provinces (\u884c\u7701), though they were not exactly provinces in modern sense. There were 11 \"regular\" provinces in the Yuan dynasty. The Yuan Central Secretariat was adopted by the early Ming dynasty, and the Central Secretariat was led by the Chancellor of China, although unlike the Yuan it did not directly control the Central Region. It was eventually abolished in 1380 after the last Chancellor Hu Weiyong was killed by Hongwu Emperor, the first emperor of the Ming, who later established the Grand Secretariat. The Central Secretariat was no longer set up again by later rulers of China, and the Three Departments and Six Ministries structure was officially replaced by the Six Ministries structure.",

    "evidence": "By Meg Wagner, Fernando Alfonso III, Mike Hayes, Tara John, Jessie Yeung and Bianca Britton, CNNFrom CNN's Gianluca MezzofioreScenes of devastation in the Marsh Harbour area of the Abaco Islands\u00a0has been shared on Twitter by eyewitness Vernal Cooper, who found shelter at a government building when the eye of the storm hit. \u201cThere\u2019s damages everywhere around my area,\u201d Cooper said, who posted the video on Monday night.  \u201cCars and houses destroyed.  This is what\u2019s left of Marsh Harbour.  This needs to end. \u201dHe says his home was also affected by the category 5 hurricane. Cooper added that many people in Abaco are struggling to contact their relatives  because power outages have cut communication lines.  \"So many family members are worried. \"From CNN\u2019s Mitchell McCluskey and Helena de Moura in AtlantaThe death of an eight-year-old boy, the first reported fatality caused from Hurricane Dorian, has been reported by local news outlets Eyewitness News and Bahamas Press. The boy\u2019s grandmother, Ingrid McIntosh, told Eyewitness News in the Bahamas that her grandson died on Abaco Island. McIntosh said her daughter told her that she found the body of her son, who she believed drowned in the rising waters.  McIntosh added that her granddaughter is also missing. \u201cAll I can say is that my daughter called from Abaco and said that her son -- my grandson -- is dead.  That\u2019s it.  I don\u2019t know what really happened.  I think she said he drowned,\u201d McIntosh said. CNN has contacted Bahamian authorities who have not yet confirmed these reports. Many people are without adequate shelter as Hurricane Dorian's category 5 winds and rains caused \"extensive damage\" to the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, according to initial assessments from authorities and Red Cross officials on the ground. As many as 13,000 homes have been severely damaged or destroyed, according to a statement from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and extensive flooding has created an \"urgent need\" for clean water as wells become contaminated with saltwater. The IFRC said it has released 250,000 Swiss francs (US$252,000) \"to bolster the first wave\" of its response as it provides around 500 families with emergency shelter assistance. \"Hundreds of trained Red Cross volunteers, emergency response vehicles and more than 30 truck loads of relief supplies are being mobilized to help people living in the path of Hurricane Dorian,\" the statement added. Hurricane Dorian will \"continue to pound\" Grand Bahama Island for the rest of today and tonight and will move \"dangerously close\" to Florida's east coast, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned in its latest update. As of 5 a. m.  ET the hurricane's center was about 40 miles east of Freeport Grand, Bahama Island, with maximum sustained winds of 165mph. \"Although gradual weakening is forecast, Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days,\" the NHC added. Read the full update here. The British Royal Navy auxiliary ship, RFA Mounts Bay, is due to arrive in the Bahamas today, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The ship was deployed to the region in June in anticipation of hurricane season and was redirected to the Bahamas when news of Hurricane\u00a0Dorian\u00a0broke, according to a Ministry of Defence spokesperson. The ship carries aid, building materials, a helicopter, specialist transport equipment, and surveying equipment, said the spokesperson. The ship will be on standby \u201cready\u201d to help as soon as an official request is made by authorities. There's no sleep for residents in Grand Bahama Island as Hurricane Dorian rages on, at 4 a. m. \"We are being lashed here in Freeport in the island of Grand Bahama\u00a0by Dorian's winds all night long\u00a0in the dark because power is out\u00a0here. \u00a0It sounds like a jet engine,\u00a0just screaming winds that pick\u00a0up but never really go away,\" said CNN correspondent Patrick Oppmann. He added that Dorian is an unprecedented storm in the Bahamas, with storm surges a major concern.  The surge could exceed 20 feet and the highest point on Grand Bahama is 30 feet, Oppmann said. \"Much of this island by the end\u00a0of today, by tomorrow will be\u00a0underwater,\" he said. Watch the segment here:Hurricane Dorian came to a virtual halt over Grand Bahama island in the early hours of Monday morning, as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of potential \u201cextreme destruction. \u201dHome to about 50,000 people, Grand Bahama is being \u201clashed incessantly with destructive hurricane-force winds,\u201d according to the NHC\u2019s latest update at 4 a. m.  Monday. The maximum sustained winds have slowed slightly to 165 miles per hour -- dropping 20 mph from its peak of 185 mph earlier Sunday evening.  But the force of the hurricane is even more dangerous combined with how slow it is moving -- it is only traveling at 1 mph. Instead of barrelling past, the hurricane and its destructive winds are hovering over the region for hours at a time.  The NHC warned that the hurricane would continue to batter Grand Bahama for most of Monday. \u00a0 Read the NHC update here. Chef Jose Andres and his nonprofit\u00a0World Central Kitchen team are in the Bahamas to serve food to people in need. Andr\u00e9s told CNN his team arrived in the islands before Hurricane Dorian hit, so they could start serving meals as quickly as possible after the storm passes. World Central Kitchen served meals in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in 2017, and the team went to South Carolina during Hurricane Florence last year.  They even fed hungry furloughed workers during the government shutdown.

Joe Biden, Kamala Harris deliver 1st message of unity after historic winJoe Biden is set to become the 46th president of the United States, capping a tumultuous and tension-filled campaign during a historic pandemic against President Donald Trump.  ABC News characterized Joe Biden as the apparent winner of his home state of Pennsylvania, putting him over the 270 vote threshold needed to capture the presidency. The hard-fought battle against the president was set against the backdrop of racial unrest and the coronavirus pandemic and bitter divisions among the electorate. Trump had falsely declared on election night, when he held a lead in several key states, that he won the contest and alleged without evidence, after the count started to swing the other way, that the election was being stolen from him and that fraud had been committed. Painting the election as a \"battle for the soul of the nation,\" Biden won on a message of unity over division, compassion over anger, and reality over what he called Trump's \"wishful thinking\" as the coronavirus pandemic cast a heavy shadow over the campaign.

A Justice Department official confirmed Monday evening that Richard Pilger, a career official who was serving as director of the Elections Crimes Branch, has resigned from his role in the division because of the attorney general's memo authorizing U. S.  attorneys to \"pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities,\" despite little evidence surfacing thus far of any widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Pilger has stepped back into a role in the DOJ's Public Integrity Section. The New York Times reported that Pilger wrote to colleagues in an email this evening, \"Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the Election Crimes Branch. \u201dA DOJ spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Pilger's resignation. When ABC News sought a response from Pilger, an automatic reply to the email said, \"I am no longer the Director of the Election Crimes Branch, and have stepped back to the line at the Public Integrity Section. \"-ABC News' Alexander MallinThe Biden transition team will not receive full intelligence briefings until the\u00a0General Services Administration officially \"ascertains\"\u00a0the former vice president to be winner of the presidential election, according to a statement from the Office of Director of National Intelligence on Monday. \"ODNI follows the statutory direction provided in the Presidential Transition Act, which requires ascertainment of the candidate by the administrator of GSA prior to supporting a potential presidential transition.  ODNI would not have contact with any transition team until notified by the GSA Administrator,\"\u00a0an ODNI spokesperson said in a statement. Meanwhile, outside government watchdogs are already warning that a continued delay in briefings could carry grave national security implications for the incoming administration. Aaron Scherb, the legal director at Common Cause, told ABC News on Monday that the \"petty and unproductive\" decision by GSA to withhold key resources to the Biden transition could have the \"potential for catastrophic results. \"\u00a0\"By GSA not signing off on this, there is certainly some classified intelligence information that the incoming administration would not have access to -- and would potentially not be fully prepared on day one to be able to counteract ongoing efforts from our adversaries like all previous incoming administrations have,\" Scherb said. \"If the Biden transition team doesn't have access to some of the documents and information,\" he continued, \"there are national security concerns. \"-ABC News' Molly Nagle and Lucien BruggemanAttorney General William Barr sent a memo to U. S.  attorneys Monday evening authorizing them to \"pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities,\" despite little evidence surfacing thus far of any widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In the memo Barr says that such inquiries \"may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State. \"But Barr emphasized in the letter that this should not be taken as the DOJ believing there was widespread fraud -- a baseless claim being made by attorneys for Trump and the RNC.  Rather, he's doling authority out to U. S.  attorneys in the event they might uncover any such credible evidence of a fraud conspiracy that might affect vote tabulations before election results are certified. \"Nothing here should be taken as any indication that the Department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election,\" Barr wrote.  \"Rather, I provide this authority and guidance to emphasize the need to timely and appropriately address allegations of voting irregularities so that all of the American people, regardless of their preferred candidate or party, can have full confidence in the results of our elections. \"\"While it is imperative that credible allegations be addressed in a timely and effective manner, it is equally imperative that Department personnel exercise appropriate caution and maintain the Department's absolute commitment to fairness, neutrality and non-partisanship,\" Barr said in the memo.  \"While serious allegations should be handled with great care, specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims should not be a basis for initiating federal inquiries. \"-ABC News' Alexander MallinBiden is slated to give remarks focused on the Affordable Care Act and the Trump administration's lawsuit to overturn it. \u00a0Biden will talk about his own plan \"to expand access to quality, affordable health care. \"The event in Wilmington, Delaware, is slated for 2 p. m. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments at 10 a. m.  in the case brought by Trump\u00a0and 18 Republican-led states asking that the\u00a0Affordable Care Act be eliminated\u00a0in its entirety.

Sometimes described as `` the father of modern linguistics '' , Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science . He is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -LRB- MIT -RRB- , where he has worked since 1955 , and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism .   Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . At the age of sixteen he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania , taking courses in linguistics , mathematics , and philosophy . From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University 's Society of Fellows , where he developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which remodeled the scientific study of language , while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism , being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner .   An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay `` The Responsibility of Intellectuals '' . Associated with the New Left , he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon 's Enemies List . While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades , he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars . In collaboration with Edward S. Herman , Chomsky later co-wrote an analysis articulating the propaganda model of media criticism , and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor . However , his defense of unconditional freedom of speech -- including for Holocaust deniers -- generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s . Following his retirement from active teaching , he has continued his vocal political activism , including opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy movement .   One of the most cited scholars in history , Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields . He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences , contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind . In addition to his continued scholarly research , he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy , neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism , the Israeli -- Palestinian conflict , and mainstream news media . His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements , but have also drawn criticism , with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism . ",

While he confessed to 27 murders , only nine could be plausibly confirmed and several of the murders he confessed to were people who were still alive . He is commonly said to have killed as many as 200 , though this figure is traceable only to 1940s pulp magazines . Many victims were said to have been killed in a mixed-use building he owned , located about 3 mi west of the 1893 Chicago World 's Fair and said to have been a World 's Fair Hotel , though evidence suggests that the hotel portion was never truly open for business .   Besides being a serial killer , Holmes was also a successful con artist and a bigamist , the subject of more than 50 lawsuits in Chicago alone . Many now-common stories of his crimes sprang from fictional accounts that later authors took for fact ; however , in a 2017 biography , Adam Selzer wrote that Holmes ' story is `` effectively a new American tall tale - and , like all the best tall tales , it sprang from a kernel of truth '' .

Clarke , partially inspired by Clarke 's short story `` The Sentinel '' . Clarke concurrently wrote the novel 2001 : A Space Odyssey , published soon after the film was released . The film follows a voyage to Jupiter with the sentient computer Hal after the discovery of a mysterious black monolith affecting human evolution . It deals with the themes of existentialism , human evolution , technology , artificial intelligence , and extraterrestrial life . It is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight , pioneering special effects , and ambiguous imagery . It uses sound and minimal dialogue in place of traditional narrative techniques ; the soundtrack consists of classical music such as Gayane Ballet Suite , The Blue Danube , Also sprach Zarathustra , and pieces from contemporary composer Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti .   2001 : A Space Odyssey was financed and distributed by American studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , but it was filmed and edited almost entirely in England using the studio facilities of the MGM-British Studios and those of Shepperton Studios , mostly because of the availability of much larger sound stages than in the United States . Production was subcontracted to Kubrick 's production company , and care was taken that the film would be sufficiently British to qualify for subsidy from the Eady Levy . Kubrick had shot his previous two films in England and decided to settle there permanently during filming .   2001 : A Space Odyssey initially received mixed reactions from critics and audiences , but it garnered a cult following and slowly became the highest-grossing North American film of 1968 . It was nominated for four Academy Awards and received one for its visual effects . The sequel 2010 was released in 1984 , directed by Peter Hyams .   Today , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made . In 1991 , it was deemed `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry . The critics ' polls in the 2002 and 2012 editions of Sight & Sound magazine ranked 2001 : A Space Odyssey sixth in the top ten films of all time ; it also tied for second place in the directors ' poll of the same magazine . In 2010 , it was named the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal . ",

The Party\u2019s state unit Chief D K Shivakumar said the entire Congress party in Karnataka stands by the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family. \u201cMrs.  Gandhi has led the Congress during times of crisis and saved our party. Anything that has to be discussed must be done so in the party forum and not in the media,\u201d he tweeted. Leader of the Opposition in the assembly and Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah termed the development as \u201cunfortunate\u201d. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the leadership of Gandhi family is being questioned by a few.  In these difficult times of undeclared emergency & attack on democracy by @BJP4India, we should collectively strive to strengthen @INCIndia & not weaken it,\u201d the former Chief Minister tweeted.  The tweets by Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar came amid reports that 23 Congress leaders have written to party chief Sonia Gandhi on the leadership issue.  Having a \u201cfull time\u201d leadership that is active in the field and \u201cvisible\u201d in party offices, dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC in line with the party constitution are some of the far-reaching suggestions made by 23 senior Congress leaders in a letter to Sonia Gandhi to revive the organisation, sources said on Sunday.  They were also critical of the way the Congress Working Committee, the party\u2019s apex decision-making body, was being constituted and was functioning. Shivakumar has also written to Sonia Gandhi, requesting her not get perturbed by any developments in the party and continue to lead it, or persuade Rahul Gandhi to take up the leadership. \u201cWe all stand by you and we go by your decisions and directions. If you feel that it is time to pass on the mantle of leadership, you may do so by kindly persuading Shri Rahul Ji to take up the leadership. We, as loyal and committed Congress workers,will continue to be loyal to you and will wait to be led by you,\u201d he said. Siddaramaiah too later in a series of tweets said Rahul Gandhi should take charge as AICC President \u201cin the interest of our country. \u201d \u201cHis leadership will rejuvenate Congress, energise party workers and reassure the people of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that Shri. @RahulGandhi, under the guidance of Smt. Sonia Gandhi & other senior leaders, will successfully lead Indian National Congress party. Even our party workers feel the same,\u201d Siddaramaiah said in another tweet.  ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Health experts and critics called the decision \"premature\" and \"reckless. \"Biden calls it a mistake for states to lift COVID-19 restrictionsGov.  Greg Abbott's announcement that Texas would end a statewide mask mandate and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity has been met with harsh criticism. \"Absolutely reckless,\" California Gov.  Gavin Newsom wrote on Twitter shortly after the press conference Tuesday in which Abbott announced that it was \"time to open Texas 100%. \"Abbott pointed to small business owners hurt by the pandemic. \"Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,\" he said.  \"Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills.  This must end. \"Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the Democratic party in Texas, issued a statement pushing back on Abbott's decision. \"What Abbott calls pro-business is anti-people,\" Hinojosa said.  \"Make no mistake: Opening Texas prematurely will only lead to faster COVID spread, more sickness and overcrowding in our hospitals, and unnecessary deaths.  There is no economic recovery without beating the coronavirus pandemic.  This will set us back, not move us forward. \"Research has shown that widespread mask wearing is good for the economy.  According to an analysis of U. S.  data that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlighted, increasing universal masking by 15% \"could prevent the need for lockdowns and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion,\" roughly 5% of U. S.  gross domestic product. Health experts similarly questioned the governor's decision to open the state and lift the mask mandate, which had been in place since July.  The new rules are effective March 10. \"This is definitely not the time to being doing this,\" Dr.  Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told MSNBC. While cases in Texas have declined from their peak, variants of the virus, like B. 1. 1. 7, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, pose a risk to that downward trend, according to Hotez. \"We are all anticipating another major wave,\" he said.  Texas is also behind on vaccinations following a winter storm that knocked out its power grid and snarled vaccine distribution. \"Let's get a much higher percentage of the population of Texas vaccinated,\" Hotez added.  \"To do it now, I think, is premature. \"Other health experts urged Texas to stay the course and keep wearing masks, regardless of whether it's required. \"Even if it is not mandated, as a health care professional I urge all Texans to wear our masks until enough of our community is vaccinated that we approach herd immunity,\" Dr.  Marc Boom, president and CEO of Houston Methodist Hospital, said in a statement.  \"Besides being vaccinated, wearing a mask is the most effective way to keep infections down and begin to return to normal.  We strongly encourage you to make the personal decision to keep wearing your mask. \"Dr.  Anthony Fauci had previously cautioned states against reopening too quickly.  At a White House briefing on Friday, Fauci warned against easing restrictions until the U. S.  baseline average of new infections is lower. \"We have to carefully look at what happens over the next week or so with those numbers\" before relaxing certain restrictions, Fauci said.  \"Watch it closely, and be prepared to react according to what actually happens. \"White House senior COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt told CNN Tuesday night he hopes Abbott will rethink lifting restrictions, especially the mask mandate, though he stopped short of suggesting President Joe Biden should call the governor to ask him to change course. \"We think it's a mistake to lift these mandate too early.  Masks are saving a lot of lives,\" he said.  \"The president has been clear about the fact that in the first 100 days of this administration, we could save 50,000 lives if we stick to this.  I'm hoping that the businesses, and the community and people in Texas, the mayors, the county, will rethink this.  I hope the governor rethinks this.  It's only a small piece of cloth that's needed. \"ABC News' Mark Osborne contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "claim": "The Punisher is a real person.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "The Punisher -LRB- Francis `` Frank '' Castle -RRB- is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . The character was created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita Sr. and Ross Andru , with publisher Stan Lee green-lighting the name . The Punisher made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man # 129 -LRB- cover-dated Feb. 1974 -RRB- .   The Punisher is a vigilante who employs murder , kidnapping , extortion , coercion , threats of violence , and torture in his war on crime . Driven by the deaths of his wife and two children , who were killed by the mob for witnessing a killing in New York City 's Central Park , the Punisher wages a one-man war on the mob and all criminals in general by using all manner of conventional war weaponry . His family 's killers were the first to be slain . A war veteran and a United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper , Frank Castle -LRB- born Francis Castiglione -RRB- is a master of martial arts , stealth tactics , guerrilla warfare , and a wide variety of weapons .   The Punisher 's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him a novel character in mainstream American comic books in 1974 . By the late 1980s , he was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes and at the height of his popularity , was featured in four monthly publications , including The Punisher , The Punisher War Journal , The Punisher War Zone , and The Punisher Armory . Despite his violent actions and dark nature , the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television , making guest appearances on Spider-Man : The Animated Series , and The Super Hero Squad Show , where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers . In feature films , Dolph Lundgren portrayed the Punisher in 1989 , as did Thomas Jane in 2004 , and Ray Stevenson in 2008 . Jon Bernthal portrays the character in the second season of Marvel 's Daredevil as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Bernthal is set to reprise the role in The Punisher , his own self-titled series . , A character -LRB- sometimes known as a fictional character -RRB- is a person or other being in a narrative work of art -LRB- such as a novel , play , television series , or film -RRB- . The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person , in which case the distinction of a `` fictional '' versus `` real '' character may be made . Derived from the ancient Greek word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 , the English word dates from the Restoration , although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749 . From this , the sense of `` a part played by an actor '' developed . Character , particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema , involves `` the illusion of being a human person . '' In literature , characters guide readers through their stories , helping them to understand plots and ponder themes . Since the end of the 18th century , the phrase `` in character '' has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor . Since the 19th century , the art of creating characters , as practiced by actors or writers , has been called characterisation .   A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type . Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised . The characters in Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler -LRB- 1891 -RRB- and August Strindberg 's Miss Julie -LRB- 1888 -RRB- , for example , are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender , such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts .   The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work . The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions -LRB- proairetic , pragmatic , linguistic , proxemic -RRB- that it forms with the other characters . The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically , often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality , self-determination , and the social order .

Holley was born in Lubbock , Texas , to a musical family during the Great Depression ; he learned to play guitar and to sing alongside his siblings . His style was influenced by gospel music , country music , and rhythm and blues acts , and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school . He made his first appearance on local television in 1952 , and the following year he formed the group `` Buddy and Bob '' with his friend Bob Montgomery . In 1955 , after opening for Elvis Presley , Holly decided to pursue a career in music . He opened for Presley three times that year ; his band 's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll . In October that year , when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets , Holly was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall , who helped him get a contract with Decca Records .   Holly 's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley . Unhappy with Bradley 's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there , Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis , New Mexico , and recorded a demo of `` That 'll Be the Day '' , among other songs . Petty became the band 's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records , which released it as a single credited to `` The Crickets '' , which became the name of Holly 's band . In September 1957 , as the band toured , `` That 'll Be the Day '' topped the US `` Best Sellers in Stores '' chart and the UK Singles Chart . Its success was followed in October by another major hit , `` Peggy Sue '' .   The album Chirping Crickets , released in November 1957 , reached number five on the UK Albums Chart . Holly made his second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1958 and soon after , toured Australia and then the UK . In early 1959 , Holly assembled a new band , consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings -LRB- bass -RRB- , famed session musician Tommy Allsup -LRB- guitar -RRB- , and Carl Bunch -LRB- drums -RRB- , and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. . After a show in Clear Lake , Iowa , Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show , in Moorhead , Minnesota . Soon after takeoff , the plane crashed , killing Holly , Ritchie Valens , The Big Bopper , and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don McLean as `` The Day the Music Died '' .   During his short career , Holly wrote , recorded , and produced his own material . He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars , bass , and drums . Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists , including The Beatles , The Rolling Stones , Eric Clapton , and Elton John . He was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , in 1986 . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of `` 100 Greatest Artists '' . ",

    "evidence": "The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company . The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life epitomized by the Simpson family , which consists of Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa , and Maggie . The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture , society , television , and the human condition .   The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks . Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family , substituting Bart for his own name . The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 . After a three-season run , the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became an early hit for Fox , becoming the network 's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season -LRB- 1989 -- 90 -RRB- .   Since its debut on December 17 , 1989 , episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast . Its 28th season began on September 25 , 2016 . It is the longest-running American sitcom and the longest-running American animated program , and , in 2009 , it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series . The Simpsons Movie , a feature-length film , was released in theaters worldwide on July 27 , 2007 , and grossed over $ 527 million . On November 4 , 2016 , the series was renewed for a twenty-ninth and thirtieth season of 22 episodes each , extending the show to 2019 .   The Simpsons received widespread critical acclaim throughout its first nine seasons , which are generally considered its `` Golden Age '' . Time named it the 20th century 's best television series , and Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it `` television 's crowning achievement regardless of format '' . On January 14 , 2000 , the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series , including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards , 30 Annie Awards , and a Peabody Award . Homer 's exclamatory catchphrase `` D'oh ! '' has been adopted into the English language , while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms . Despite this , the show has also been criticized for what many perceive as a decline in quality over the years . ",

    "evidence": "Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven of his ministers went into quarantine on Friday after 23 state government officials who were part of the rescue operation at a plane crash site in Kozhikode tested positive for coronavirus.  In a brief statement, the CM\u2019s office said he will be going in self-quarantine and won\u2019t be able to unfurl the Tricolour on Independence Day and it will be done by the state tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran.  The CM and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan had visited Kozhikode in north Kerala with a big team a day after the air tragedy that claimed 18 lives, including two pilots.  The decision came after Malappuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan and police superintendent U Abdul Kareem tested positive, along with 21 other officials who supervised the rescue work with local people after the Air India Express evacuation plane from Dubai skidded and crashed last Friday.  Seven ministers, including health minister KK Shailaja and state director general of police (DGP) Loknath Behera, have put themselves into quarantine.  District officials were at the crash site for many hours and led the rescue operations with the aid of local people.  In fact they were in quarantine after two injured in the crash tested positive.  \u201cSome symptoms were there since yesterday and later it was confirmed positive.  This is part of our job.  I am relieved we could limit the death toll to 18,\u201d said collector K Gopalakrishnan, who reached the spot in 20 minutes and took command of the rescue work.  Though the airport is known after Kozhikode, it is in Malappuram district, at least 25 kms away from Kozhikode city.  Earlier the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had also asked its personnel who took part in the rescue operation to go in quarantine.  Kondotty, where the airport is situated, was a containment zone but youngsters came out in large numbers which was later lauded by many, including Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Air India.  Local people are also in quarantine and their test results are yet to come.  Meanwhile, the state reported 1569 new cases and 10 deaths.  Death toll went up to 140 and total cases stood at 41, 246.  State health minister KK Shailaja said cases are likely to peak by next month and experts have warned daily cases will go up to 15,000.

    "evidence": "The victims range in age from 20 to 65. Boulder district attorney discusses investigation into mass shootingTen people, including a police officer, were killed in Boulder, Colorado, on Monday afternoon when a gunman opened fire at a King Soopers grocery store, where residents had gathered to shop and receive COVID-19 vaccines. The victims range in age from 20 to 65, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold\u00a0said. The slain officer, 51-year-old Eric Talley, was the first member of law enforcement to arrive at the scene, Herold said.  He was shot in the head, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. The other victims were identified as: Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. The shooting was reported at about 2:40 p. m.  local time, police said.  Officers arrived within minutes, entering the store and engaging with the suspect, who was shot in the exchange of gunfire, according to police. The suspect, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, of Arvada, Colorado, suffered a leg wound and was taken into custody at 3:28 p. m.  Monday, the chief said. The suspect has been charged with 10 counts of murder, Herold said.  He was expected to be taken to the Boulder County Jail Tuesday following his release from the hospital, Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said. The victims were found in the store and in the parking lot.  One person was in a car in the lot, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. The chief said she lives several blocks from the store. \"I feel numb.  And it's heartbreaking,\" she said at a Tuesday news conference. Talley had been a member of the Boulder Police Department since 2010. He \"loved this community,\" the police chief said.  \"He's everything that policing deserves and needs. \"President Joe Biden said Tuesday, \"Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives.  That's the definition of an American hero. \"Talley was a father of seven. \"He loved his kids and his family more than anything,\" Talley's father, Homer Talley, said in a statement to ABC News. Talley's father said the late officer joined the police force when he was 40 years old and recently started training to be a drone operator so he could get a job to keep himself off the front lines. \"He didn't want to put his family through something like this,\" Homer Talley said. Victim Rikki Olds, 25, was a \"strong, independent\" young woman who worked at the grocery store, her uncle, Robert Olds, told ABC News. Her boyfriend rushed to the store parking lot in hopes of good news, he said. \"She was so loved and she will be so missed,\" Robert Olds said.  \"We are heartbroken and saddened and devastated. \"The suspect bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. Biden urged lawmakers on Tuesday to take action by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \"I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps,\" he said. The Senate \"should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system,\" Biden said. Biden has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House.  Last week, the president ordered flags to fly at half-staff in honor of the Georgia spa shooting victims.  That order expired at sunset on Monday. Former President Barack Obama said in a statement, \"It is long past time for those with the power to fight this epidemic of gun violence to do so. \"\"We can overcome opposition by cowardly politicians and the pressure of a gun lobby that opposes any limit on the ability of anyone to assemble an arsenal,\" Obama said.  \"We can, and we must. \"Colorado Congressman Joe Neguse told reporters Tuesday, \"We need to see a change because we have lost far too many lives. \"As the shooting unfolded Monday afternoon, eyewitnesses shared videos from the parking lot on social media.  The videos showed officers ordering a suspect to come out of the store with his hands up and surrender.  Eyewitness videos from inside the supermarket show shoppers and employees trying to flee or hide. Andy Arellano, who works at the King Soopers store, told ABC Denver affiliate KMGH that he was concerned for his colleagues and shoppers as gunshots rang out. \"We were like sitting ducks, you know, and that's one thing that I'm reliving it and looking at it in my head,\" Arellano said.  \"And that, that bothers me, I'm still shivering, I'm still shaking. \"Andrew Hummel told KMGH that he was at another store in the same shopping center when he heard the shots, prompting him and others to run out. Hummel said his roommate works at the store and hid in a storage room with some customers, texting updates to him. \"I think one of the biggest scary text[s] that he sent, he just said, 'I love you guys, like, thank you for everything, in case, like, things go bad,'\" Hummel said.  \"That's something that I would never want to hear from any of my friends, because I knew the seriousness of what was going on.  And I was horrified. \"Colorado Gov.  Jared Polis said in a statement, \"Tonight, the families of these victims, our fellow Coloradans, my neighbors, are hearing the devastating news that their loved one who simply woke up and went to work this morning, or who ran out to pick up eggs, won't be coming home. \"\"Today we saw the face of evil.  I am grieving with my community and all Coloradans,\" he said. The King Soopers supermarket chain and its parent company, Kroger, released a joint statement Monday evening, offering \"thoughts, prayers and support to our associates, customers, and the first responders who so bravely responded to this tragic situation. \"\"We will continue to cooperate with local law enforcement and our store will remain closed during the police investigation,\" the statement added.

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "The Poona Pact refers to an agreement between Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi signed on 24 September 1932 at Yerwada Central Jail in Pune , India . It was signed by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other leaders to break the fast unto death undertaken by Gandhi in Yerwada prison to annul the Macdonald Award giving separate electorates to Dalits for electing members of state legislative assemblies in British India .   History of the Poona Pact  The British invited leaders of different parties in the Round Table Conferences in 1930-32 to draft a new law involving self-rule for the Indians . Mahatma Gandhi did not attend the first and the last but attended the second of the Conferences . The concept of separate electorates for the untouch was raised by Ambedkar . Similar provisions were already available for other minorities , including Muslims , Christians , Anglo-Indians and Sikhs . The British government agreed with Ambedkar 's contention and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald 's Communal Award to the depressed classes was to be incorporated into the constitution in the governance of British India . Gandhi strongly opposed the Communal Award on the grounds that it would disintegrate Hindu society . Ambedkar vehemently criticised the way of handling the problems of the Harijans by Gandhiji . Gandhi took up a fast unto death in his prison cell in Poona , protesting that separate electorates were a device which would separate the untouchables from the Hindu society forever . He began an indefinite hunger strike at Yerwada Central Jail from 20 September 1932 to protest against this Award . A compromise was reached on 24 September 1932 .   The text uses the term `` Depressed Classes '' to denote Untouchables who were later called Scheduled Castes under India Act 1935 , and the later Indian Constitution of 1950 . ",

The battle started after Mehmed, who already had tense relations with Vlad, discovered his alliance with Hungary's king Matthias Corvinus and ordered his forces to ambush him. Vlad foiled the attack and invaded Bulgaria. In response, Mehmed raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the conflict where Vlad attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed. The assassination attempt failed and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, where he found a few men with cannons. After leaving the capital, Mehmed discovered 23,844 impaled Turks whom Vlad had killed during his invasion of Bulgaria. The number is mentioned by Vlad himself in a letter to Matthias Corvinus. The sultan and his troops then sailed to Br\u0103ila and burned it to the ground before retreating to Adrianople.

    "claim": "Microwaving fabric masks is a good way to sanitize them for reuse.",
    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": " Snopes is still fighting an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help. Find out what we\u2019ve learned and how to inoculate yourself against COVID-19 misinformation. Read the latest fact checks about the vaccines. Submit any questionable rumors and \u201cadvice\u201d you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.    On April 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new recommendation to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease: People should wear cloth or fabric face masks when they go grocery shopping, visit pharmacies, or do other essential errands. Made from T-shirts or bandanas, these face coverings are an at-home alternative to surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which the CDC recommended only for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic. The recommendation \u2014 which the CDC posted in a statement on its website alongside a 45-second video of U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrating how to make one of the cloth masks \u2014 spurred a wave of do-it-yourself guides online. But this raised a new dilemma among crafty Americans making their own masks: How should people clean the masks in order to safely reuse them? Making a new face guard for each trip outside could prove tedious. Cue the advice of Facebook: \u201cThose that use a fabric mask \u2013 after wearing place in ziplock bag and microwave 2-3 minutes to sanitize. Do this after each wear,\u201d says a post that users have shared more than 7,200 times. Another post with similar advice has about five times that amount of shares. People contacted Snopes seeking clarity. According to an April 9 instructional guide by the CDC, people who go outside wearing fabric or cloth masks should clean them regularly, the frequency of which depends on how often the face coverings are used. When asked by Snopes if microwaving cloth masks will sanitize them, a CDC spokesperson responded via email with a bulleted list of what cloth face coverings should do, including \u201cfit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face\u201d and \u201cbe able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.\u201d The latter bullet point was highlighted yellow in the email. In other words, the CDC has not explicitly forbidden the public from microwaving the face coverings nor weighed in on the effectiveness of the method. But it has made this recommendation, including in its April 9 guide: \u201cA washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.\u201d Meanwhile, Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on Facebook warned against microwaving face masks, writing on Facebook: \u201cDO NOT place any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time,\u201d the Colorado River Fire Rescue department also said on Facebook. \u201cThere is no evidence that microwaving a face mask will sanitize it properly.\u201d Proof of people\u2019s failed attempts at the microwave idea are available via social media, too. People have shared stories of kitchen fires starting in their microwave and photos of charred fabric masks. \u201cI tried it,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try it. It smells awful.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u00a0 \u201cRecommendation Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings, Especially in Areas of Significant Community-Based Transmission.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 3 April 2020",

    "label": "Neutral",
    "evidence": "The Maharashtra government has decided to extend travel restrictions for those coming from Kerala, in the state.  It has made it mandatory for travellers to carry a Covid-negative report while entering the state.  The decision on travel restrictions was taken following an observation made by a three-member team under National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), its director Dr Sujeet Singh, who was in state from Friday to Monday to take stock of the Covid-19 situation.  The team pointed out that why the state is not imposing travel restrictions for travellers coming from Kerala.  The team had visited Nagpur, Amravati, Akola and Yavatmal and pointed out that these areas have a high positivity rate. Similar travel restrictions are already in place for four states \u2014 Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat since November 23. With a total 983,376 cases of Covid-19, Kerala has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases across the country after Maharashtra.  It still has the highest active cases \u2014 64,346 \u2014 among all the states.  On Tuesday, it recorded 5,980 cases, highest in the country.  In the last one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 0. 6% every day, according to www. covid19india. orgAround 27,826 out of every one million people in Kerala have tested positive for coronavirus, it stated. \u201cFollowing the powers conferred under Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in the capacity as chairperson, state executive committee, I hereby issue orders to extend the SOP (standard operating procedure) for all the passengers arriving in Maharashtra from the state of Kerala with immediate effect, after careful consideration of planning and containment areas and availability of health infrastructure for strict implementation by the concerned authorities,\u201d states the order issued by the chief secretary Sanjay Kumar on Wednesday. \u201cThe passengers travelling in flights from Kerala will have to carry RT-PCR negative test reports before boarding and will have to produce the same on landing at airports in Maharashtra.  The RT-PCR sample collection should have been done within 72 hours before the scheduled time of landing at airports in the state,\u201d said Anoop Kumar, secretary relief and rehabilitation (additional charge). Those not having RT-PCR test reports shall have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test at the concerned airports at their own cost.  They will be allowed to go home only after undertaking the tests.  Those tested positive will have to be treated as per the existing protocol, he said. Kumar further said, \u201cThe passengers travelling in trains will also have to produce the RT-PCR negative test report, but the collection of samples should have been done within 96 hours before the scheduled arrival.  Those not having negative reports will be screened for symptoms and body temperature at the railway stations, and those having symptoms shall have to undergo antigen tests. \u201dThose coming by roads will have to undergo screening at border check posts.  Those with symptoms will have to undergo antigen tests.  If found positive, the traveller will have to be admitted to Covid centre and will have to bear the cost of the treatment, he said. \u201cKerala has highest per day growth in daily Covid-19 cases and a traveller from the state has the potential of spreading the virus in Maharashtra.  Considering this, we have decided to bring in travel restrictions for Kerala as a precautionary measure,\u201d the relief and rehabilitation secretary said. ",

Let\u2019s fact-check the authenticity of the posted image. Claim: Photo of a man holding the poster questioning the efficiency of Mumbai Police in investigating Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death. Fact: The poster in the photo has been edited.  A similar photo with different text (related to CAA and NRC) on the poster is being circulated on the internet at least since December 2019 i. e.  much before the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in June 2020.  Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, many similar images were found in the search results.  A similar photo was found being circulated on the internet at least since December 2019 i. e.  much before the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in June 2020.  The poster in the photo has different text, related to CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC (National Register of Citizens).  The posts from December 2019 can be found here, here, and here.  While the original source of the photo was not found, it can be concluded that it is definitely not related to Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death as the photo is an old one and all the previous versions are related CAA and NRC. To sum it up, this photo of a man holding poster regarding the inefficiency of Mumbai Police is photoshopped. Did you watch our new video? ",

    "label": "Support",
    "evidence": "Scabies , previously known as the seven-year itch , is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei . The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash . Occasionally tiny burrows may be seen in the skin . When first infected , usually two to six weeks are required before symptoms occur . If a person develops a second infection later in life , symptoms may begin within a day . These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists , between fingers , or along the waistline . The head may be affected , but this is typically only in young children . The itch is often worse at night . Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin .   Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var . hominis . The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs . The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites . Often only between ten and fifteen mites are involved in an infection . Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person -LRB- at least 10 minutes -RRB- such as that which may occur during sex . Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet . Crowded living conditions such as those found in child care facilities , group homes , and prisons increase the risk of spread . Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease . Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease . It typically only occurs in those with a poor immune system and people may have millions of mites , making them much more contagious . In these cases spread of infection may occur during brief contact or via contaminated objects . The mite is very small and usually not directly visible . Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms .   A number of medications are available to treat those infected , including permethrin , crotamiton and lindane creams and ivermectin pills . Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time . Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer . As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin more washing is not needed . Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment . If after this time there continue to be symptoms retreatment may be needed .   Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children , along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections . As of 2015 it affects approximately 204 million people -LRB- 2.8 % of the world population -RRB- . It is equally common in both sexes . The young and the old are more commonly affected . It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates . The word scabies is from scabere , `` to scratch '' . Other animals do not spread human scabies . Infection in other animals is typically caused by slightly different but related mites and is known as sarcoptic mange . ",

    "label": "Refute",
    "evidence": "Planet of the Apes is a 1968 American science fiction film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner . It stars Charlton Heston , Roddy McDowall , Kim Hunter , Maurice Evans , James Whitmore , James Daly and Linda Harrison . The screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling was loosely based on the 1963 French novel La Plan\u00e8te des Singes by Pierre Boulle . Jerry Goldsmith composed the groundbreaking avant-garde score . It was the first in a series of five films made between 1968 and 1973 , all produced by Arthur P. Jacobs and released by 20th Century Fox .   The film tells the story of an astronaut crew who crash-land on a strange planet in the distant future . Although the planet appears desolate at first , the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech . The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins .   The script was originally written by Rod Serling , but underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began . Directors J. Lee Thompson and Blake Edwards were approached , but the film 's producer Arthur P. Jacobs , upon the recommendation of Charlton Heston , chose Franklin J. Schaffner to direct the film . Schaffner 's changes included an ape society less advanced -- and therefore less expensive to depict -- than that of the original novel . Filming took place between May 21 and August 10 , 1967 , in California , Utah and Arizona , with desert sequences shot in and around Lake Powell , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area . The film 's final `` closed '' cost was $ 5.8 million .   The film was released on February 8 , 1968 , in the United States and was a commercial success , earning a lifetime domestic gross of $ 32.6 million . The film was groundbreaking for its prosthetic makeup techniques by artist John Chambers and was well received by critics and audiences , launching a film franchise , including four sequels , as well as a short-lived television show , animated series , comic books , and various merchandising . In particular , Roddy McDowall had a long-running relationship with the Apes series , appearing in four of the original five films -LRB- absent , apart from a brief voiceover , from the second film of the series , Beneath the Planet of the Apes , in which he was replaced by David Watson in the role of Cornelius -RRB- , and also in the television series .   The original series was followed by Tim Burton 's remake Planet of the Apes in 2001 and the reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011 . Also in 2001 , Planet of the Apes was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .

He was caught by women in the area who stripped him naked and beat him up. Strict action must be taken against a personal with such mentality and he should be hanged.)\u201d The video is also being shared widely on Facebook with the same claim. TRUE OR FALSE? The Quint could confirm that while the incident is true and it happened at the Jain Bazaar area in Ambala, it is being shared with a false communal angle. The accused in the case is not Muslim but one Pawan Kumar, who is a resident of Ambala city. WHAT WE FOUND? We reached out to Inspector Sunita, SHO, Women Police Station Ambala, who told us that Kumar is accused of sexually harassing three girls, all aged five years. \u201cThe victims have alleged that the accused, Kumar, would flash his private parts at them on their way to school. When one of them complained to her mother, she followed the girls and caught Kumar harassing the girls. It was then that women in the area stripped him and beat him up,\u201d she said. The police also informed us that an FIR has been registered against Kumar under Section 12 of POCSO Act. We also came across a news report by The Times Of India, which corroborated these details. Clearly, the case is being shared with a false communal angle. (The story has also been debunked by AltNews.) ",

A caption with the picture shared in the article reads 'Students at Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami studying the Vedas to understand the common attributes in Islam and Hinduism. This seminary has more than 1000 books on other religions at Hyderabad. PHOTO: G_RAMAKRISHNA'. The article published on April 2, 2014 mentioned that the seminary is located in Hyderabad, Telangana. According to the report, the seminary was going to impart Islamic as well as modern education to its students from the upcoming academic year.  BOOM also contacted the deputy director of the Hyderabad-based seminary, Osman Abedeen, who rubbished the viral claims. \"The photograph was captured some six years ago and the scholars are reading in a library. I do not remember clearly, but the viral claims are absolutely baseless and nonsense,\" Abedeen told BOOM. \"We have a department 'Studies of Religion' under which we study religions in India - Christianity, and Judaism. It is the research methodology to consume information from the first source and not from second or third sources. For instance, misunderstanding among the communities has been created because people did not read the religious text as they are. Either they did not read or misinterpreted the texts. This method is wrong. The right method is to read from the first source. We are the first of a kind institute in India where we have Vedas, Upanishadas, Bhagwat Gita, Guru Granth Saheb, and Bible. We encourage our scholars and students to read original books to understand religion,\" Abedeen explained. \"We also had a teacher of Sanskrit,\"  he said and added, \"Vedas are not new, who can change Vedas? It is evident that a library is called complete when you have all the sources of a subject. We have nearly 1,500 books written by original writers,\" he said. BOOM also contacted journalist JS Ifthekhar who had written the article. Ifthekhar said that the photo was taken in the seminary's library which had books from many religions including Hinduism and Sikhism. \"It's kind of a course in comparative religious studies,\" Ifthekhar told BOOM.

Born approximately 570CE -LRB- Year of the Elephant -RRB- in the Arabian city of Mecca , Muhammad was orphaned at an early age ; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib . Periodically , he would seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer ; later , at age 40 , he reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , where he stated he received his first revelation from God . Three years later , in 610 , Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that `` God is One '' , that complete `` surrender '' -LRB- lit . isl\u0101m -RRB- to him is the right course of action -LRB- d\u012bn -RRB- , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam .   Muhammad gained few early followers , and met hostility from some Meccan tribes . To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina -LRB- then known as Yathrib -RRB- in the year 622 . This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , also known as the Hijri Calendar . In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina . In December 629 , after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes , Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca . The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed . In 632 , a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage , he fell ill and died . Before his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam .   The revelations -LRB- each known as Ayah , lit . `` Sign -LSB- of God -RSB- '' -RRB- , which Muhammad reported receiving until his death , form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the `` Word of God '' and around which the religion is based .

Since the band 's formation in 1989 , its line-up remained unchanged until the firing of Weiland in 2013 , who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington . In 2015 , Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park . On December 3 , 2015 , Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts . In 2016 , the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist .   After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young , the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots . The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album , Core -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s .

The band 's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013 .   While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career , further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences , including psychedelic rock , bossa nova and classic rock . The band 's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows , brought about in part by Weiland 's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction .
