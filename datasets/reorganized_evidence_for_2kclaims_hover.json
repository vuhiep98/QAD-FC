Instead, it suggests that avocados grow on trees and are typically picked when they are mature. Here is a revised mind map based on the evidence:\n\n\n\n* Avocados are a climacteric fruit that matures on the tree but ripens off the tree.\n* Avocados are picked when they are mature, typically with more than 23% dry matter.\n* Avocados can be left on the tree for several months, but if they remain unpicked for too long, they fall to the ground.\n\n\n* Avocados grow on trees, not on the ground.\n* Avocados are typically picked when they are mature, not when they fall to the ground.\n* While avocados can fall to the ground if they are not picked, this is not the primary method of harvesting them.\n\nThis mind map highlights the main points from the evidence, which suggest that avocados do not grow on the ground, but rather on trees."

Oh Yeon-Seo is a South Korean actress, and Jon Snow is a fictional character from the Game of Thrones series. It's unlikely that Oh Yeon-Seo was born as Jon Snow.\n\nAs a result, I cannot create a mind map that summarizes the evidence, as there is no relevant information to summarize. If you'd like to rephrase the claim or provide additional evidence, I'd be happy to help you create a mind map."

    "reorganized_evidence": "    Arizona State Rep. Leslie Johnson (R-Mesa) attempted to pass an obscenity law in the 1980s aimed at regulating pornography and banning the sale of dildos.\n    House Bill 2613, the \"dildo bill,\" would have made the commercial sale of \"obscene devices,\" such as dildos, a felony.\n    The original proposal focused only on the sale of \"obscene devices\" and not their ownership.\n    A provision of the proposed bill stated that ownership of six or more dildos would be considered proof of intent to sell them commercially \u2014 which would have made such ownership a felony.\n    The bill was eventually passed by both the House and Senate, but Gov. Rose Mofford vetoed the measure.\n    The veto was based more on the term \"obscenity,\" how it was defined, and how it would be enforced.\n    Johnson filed similar legislation the following year, but it was killed when the Arizona House amended some of the language in the bill, replacing the word \"dildo\" with \"child molestation devices.\"\n    The story behind Johnson's obscenity law was eventually boiled down to a factually inaccurate sentence published on the website Dumblaws circa 1999.\n    The rumor spread to a number of listicles concerning \"obscure laws\" in the United States.\n    Despite the widespread prevalence of the rumor, no law on the books in Arizona prohibits the number of dildos a person can own.\n    The rumor stemmed from a failed piece of 1989 legislation dubbed the \"dildo bill\" which, among other things, would have made it a felony to sell sex toys.\n    The \"ownership\" aspect of the rumor was due to language in the bill stating that owning more than six (not two) dildos would have constituted proof of intent to distribute.\n    The Phoenix New Times reported on the legislation (and several other fabled Arizona statutes) in 2013 and asserted that Arizonans \"can have dildos stacked to the rafters\" without fear of legal repercussions."

She is an American attorney and politician who has served as the Attorney General of California and as a United States Senator from California. She is also the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGiven the incorrect evidence, I won't be able to create a mind map that supports the claim. Instead, I'll provide some accurate information about Kamala Harris:\n\n* Kamala Harris:\n\t+ Profession: Politician\n\t+ Political career:\n\t\t- Attorney General of California (2011-2017)\n\t\t- United States Senator from California (2017-present)\n\t\t- Democratic nominee for Vice President (2020)\n\t+ Political affiliations: Democratic Party\n\nIf you'd like to rephrase the claim or provide accurate evidence, I'd be happy to help you create a mind map!"
